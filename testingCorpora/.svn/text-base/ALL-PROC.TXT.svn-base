tg	Hello...I'm Diane Marcotte here to talk about dowsing.
tg	Dowsing is using a tool ,usually a pendulum or rods, that allows us to gather information not directly available to our conscious mind. Because we are living in a physical world, we must, by necessity concentrate on certain data, to the exclusion of other data. As well as information coming externally we also have information coming to us internally , from our Inner Self or Higher Self, God, Spirit Guides, etc. depending on your belief system, through what we usually term our Intuition. 
tg	Hello...I'm Diane Marcotte and we'll be chatting about dowsing. 
tg	Would you please tell me what books you would recommend? 
tg	There are a number of good books on dowsing available. There are 3 that I highly recommend. 
tg	Anyone Can Dowse for Better Health by Arthur Bailey is excellent, both for beginners and experienced dowsers. Another one is The Pendulum Bridge to Infinite Knowing by Dale Olson. It is geared more towards beginners. Walt Woods has a set available entitled Powers That Be. It includes a book, a pair of dowsing rods and a pendulum. The rods and pendulum are of an excellent quality. Walt Woods also wrote Letter to Robin which you can print off the Internet.  
tg	I have tried dowsing with a pendulum but it doesn't seem to 'do' anything. Would you recommend using an object that has special meaning to the person ,eg. a ring, as the 'weight'? 
tg	Hi Doris...I guess I'll wait a few minutes to see if anyone is joining us. 
tg	No, I don't believe that what a pendulum consists of is important. 
tg	But if you are having problems sometimes using a favourite object will help. 
tg	Hi everyone 
tg	Hi Pooky 
tg	Hi Pooky, Hi Diane ,please excuse me for not saying 'Hi' before. I am new to chatting,. 
tg	Is this the beginner's dowser's chat tonight? 
tg	Me too, Doris 
tg	Yes it is. 
tg	I typed out some thoughts earlier and will retype them now. I tried cutting and  pasting before but it ran off the screen. 
tg	Okay 
tg	Dowsing is using a tool ,usually a pendulum or rods, that allows us to gather information not directly available to our conscious mind.

As well as information coming in externally we also have information coming to us internally ,from our Inner Self, Higher Self, God, Spirit Guides, etc. depending on your belief system, through what we usually term our Intuition. 
tg	Pooky, have you tried dowsing before? 
tg	I've done a little bit with a pendulum over the last couple of weeks. 
tg	My results have been inconsistent though. 
tg	That's normal. 
tg	It takes quite a bit of practice to get accurate results consistently. 
tg	I would like to be able to be more consistent? Is there any tips you can give me? 
tg	Have you been able to get your YES, NO and MAYBE responses OK? 
tg	When I ask questions I already know the answers to yes 
tg	Did you begin by asking your pendulum what direction it will move to indicate a YES answer? 
tg	Yes, I asked it to move front and back for yes. 
tg	And is NO a sideways motion? What is your ready motion? 
tg	Side to side for no, and counterclockwise for maybe. 
tg	What about you Doris? 
tg	Ready seems to be just stopping in the centre. 
tg	To get back to your question about being more consistent... 
tg	You won't get good results if you are dowsing when you are tired, out of sorts or just having trouble concentrating on your dowsing. 
tg	Sorry if I respond slowly, my computer keeps flipping to another page and I have to come back To answer, no, it doesn't really move at all. 
tg	Focusing too heavily on what the pendulum is doing also can stop you from getting accurate answers. 
tg	The focusing could be part of it...maybe I just want to know the answers to some things too badly. lol 
tg	It might be beneficial to move your arm so that you can only see the pendulum peripherally. That way you're not staring at it, willing it to move LOL 
tg	I'll have to give that one a try. Can our thoughts influence it? 
tg	hi CandyHOST 
tg	hi 
tg	Welcome Candy 
tg	we are supposed to be in room 1 
tg	OOPs 
tg	we wondered where you all were 
tg	OOps 
tg	Do I exit here and log back on? 
tg	How can we get directly to room 1 from here. The only other tab I have is rooms. 
tg	we can come to here though 
tg	brb 
tg	That would be great 
tg	Sounds good to me considering my computer problems 
tg	I agree 
tg	While we're waiting...yes Pooky your thoughts play a big role. 
tg	There are times when I have a hard time to shut them off, maybe that is not the best time to use the pendulum. 
tg	Yes, you need to be in a state of relaxed concentration. 
tg	Easy to say but not easy to do 
tg	I think that is my problem too ,no typos,
tg	Don't I know it sometimes..lol 
tg	You want to be able to concentrate just on your dowsing so being alone, feeling energetic are important. 
tg	Hi everyone 
tg	Hi Candy...sorry about the mix up 
tg	love and light to you all 
tg	tis ok Diane 
tg	to you too 
tg	we have been waiting since 9 
tg	wondering what happened to you 
tg	Are there others transferring over to this room? 
tg	yes but Uni is having puter problems 
tg	I commiserate with Uni 
tg	as we all can 
tg	sorry for the interruption Diane please go on 
tg	Candy, last week, I was able to have both rooms on the tab above...not so this week. How can I do it again? 
tg	We were just talking about how hard it is to concentrate on your dowsing. 
tg	Pooky, I have the same as you, I believe ... one tab 'Rooms' and the other 'healing2' 
tg	It is difficult to sort of stand back and and not be overly concerned about what your pendulum is doing. 
tg	Pooky if yo go to the rooms tab, click on healing1 room and join, that should do it 
tg	I have those tabs too. 
tg	Diane I have been using a pendulum for years and years 
tg	hi Moor 
tg	UniLady says please apologize to Diane for me I am so sorry 
tg	Hi Morrigan 
tg	Hi Morrigan 
tg	Hi Morrigan 
tg	love and light to you 
tg	No apology necessary I made the assumption that it was in room2 
tg	Candy, it is not an option in the rooms that I show, I scrolled and not there. 
tg	no Diane...she can't get in the chat tonight 
tg	Are there any others in Room 1 that will be transferring over? 
tg	That's 'over' 
tg	Pooky I can not do it 
tg	sorry 
tg	Tao said he was going to stay there to direct traffic and I changed the welcome greeting to send people over here 
tg	yes seen that thanks Morri 
tg	That's okay Candy. 
tg	Perhaps I should wait a few minutes before continuing? 
tg	no one else is coming over right Morri? 
tg	so you can go on Diane 
tg	Great, thanks 
tg	I'm sooo sorry diane..what's your last name again? 
tg	? 
tg	Does anyone have a specific question? 
tg	Marcotte 
tg	ty 
tg	yw 
tg	What is the best type of pendulum...metal, crystal or...? 
tg	after using pendulum for many years, I am now able to separate myself from the questions 
tg	How do you separate Candy? 
tg	I believe anything works as a pendulum. It is important not to impose any beliefs from others on yourself. And that includes what you hear from me tonight LOL 
tg	Pooky I take some deep breaths, then ask the answers to come from my Higher Self 
tg	LOL 
tg	lol 
tg	lol 
tg	I would like to dowse to try to find out if a homeless cat that I had been feeding is OK? She hasn't been seen since October. Would holding a picture of her help with my dowsing? 
tg	Mainly I want to emphasize that dowsing is simple. Not only simple to learn but the mechanics of it are simple. There are no rules 
tg	how did you get started dowsing Diane? 
tg	I have always used something that I have worn or that was mine, or if some thing else, I then cleanse first 
tg	Doris...yes sometimes that helps. It helps to focus your thoughts. 
tg	It is called a 'witness'. 
tg	It is important though to realize that you don't have to have a photo. 
tg	Does the answer come clearer when you have a witness? 
tg	It is all too easy to start believing that you need something ,a photo, a lock of hair, etc., to get results. 
tg	they are just a focusing tool though right? 
tg	About 6 years ago, Morrigan, I took a course on dowsing. 
tg	that would be neat, never done that 
tg	It involved 3 Saturdays and a weekend field trip. It was great. 
tg	I bet, it sounds like fun 
tg	maybe you could give us a brief intro on who you are and what dowsing is?? there is a dowsing society that you belong to right? 
tg	oops sorry I guess being late got me behind 
tg	No, Pooky, you don't need a witness to get clear answers. If you decide to use a witness in the beginning that would be fine. 
tg	I was wondering the same myself Morri 
tg	But once your dowsing starts giving you accurate results, I would stop using a witness. 
tg	Here's a short bio... 
tg	ty 
tg	I've only tried once with a witness, I will have to wait for the answer to that one though. 
tg	I had found that at first, it was hard to get correct answers when you were involved emotionally to what you were asking 
tg	That's exactly what I'm finding out right now Candylol 
tg	I retired a few years and now I'm quite involved with dowsing. 
tg	Pooky you will get past that point,  it took me years, so I connect to my Higher Self first 
tg	Diane? 
tg	Yes, I belong to the Canadian Society of Dowsers and am on their Board. 
tg	who are they and what is their function Diane? 
tg	I did. 
tg	We're having our 15th annual Convention in Toronto in June. It is a nonprofit organization run entirely by volunteers. 
tg	wow sounds great 
tg	I'm also a member of the American Society of Dowsers and I went to their convention last June in Vermont. They have many dowsing chapters across the US. Have any of you looked into visiting a chapter? 
tg	Are you in Toronto, Diane? 
tg	why do you prefer dowsing to any other method of divination..like for instance, Tarot cards? 
tg	Yes, I live in Toronto. 
tg	Diane do you recommend using a yes and no board? 
tg	I don't know just why I'm drawn to dowsing...probably because it is so simple. 
tg	I am a neophyte dabbler at the moment so this my basic introduction to the subject 
tg	Me too 
tg	You don't have to interpret the results like other forms of divination. 
tg	could you explain the methodology to us beginners? 
tg	Could you explain please just what you mean by a Yes and No board. 
tg	I have seen boards with 'yes and no' on them, I assumed it was only for 'concentration' purposes 
tg	Would you like to start with how to hold a pendulum? 
tg	please 
tg	yes, please 
tg	Fine with me. 
tg	Oh...I think it best to determine a YES and NO response of your pendulum rather than having it move to the Yes or the NO on the board. 
tg	I agree with that 
tg	You want to be able to use your pendulum at any time so the fewer props you need, the better. 
tg	agree 
tg	You want the pendulum to be able to swing easily. 
tg	Start by holding the string ,between your thumb and index finger, close to the weight on the end. While swinging the pendulum back and forth slowly let out the string. After you have let out an inch or 2, swing the pendulum in a clockwise direction. You are searching for the spot where your pendulum moves freely and doesn't require much conscious movement from you. Usually this is between 2.5 and 3.5  inches. Any longer and the pendulum's movement isn't as defined...that is, it is harder to see how it is moving. It is best not to restrict your arm by leaning on anything. Although you can rest your arm against your body. 
tg	Would you like to know how to get a YES, NO and MAYBE response for those who haven't yet? 
tg	please 
tg	There are 2 ways to go about this, either by asking the pendulum to show you your YES movement OR by 'programming' it to swing in a way you have chosen. 
tg	how would you go about 'programming' it? 
tg	For those of you who have already determined your various swings please don't change them if they differ from someone else's method. Although I said you program the pendulum you're really programming yourself 
tg	 
tg	I want to digress a moment here... In the early 1900s many dowsers believed that there were emanations coming off the subject they were searching for. ,water, oil, minerals, etc.,They believed these emanations made the rod, or pendulum move, i.e., it was an external force that moved the pendulum. They went to great extents to use 'witnesses' either attached to their dowsing instrument or held in their other hand. It was believed that 'like attracts like' and that was why the rod moved. Nowadays dowsers usually subscribe to the school of thought that it is our intent expressed through a question, that brings forth the movement of the dowsing instrument. That is, it is an internal force. The way it probably works ,and no one can say for sure at this point, is that the answer, coming in through our intuition, causes the brain to initiate a minute response that is carried to the muscles of the arm and hand. The result being that the dowsing instrument is physically moved by an unconscious movement of the hand. Sorry to be so long winded there but I thought I better explain. So, back to getting a response... 
tg	it is a good explanation 
tg	By programming yourself you are telling yourself that you want the pendulum to move in a certain fashion. 
tg	Your explanation was very clear, thanks 
tg	Then repeat for your NO. Is anyone practicing this now and having any trouble?  
tg	no 
tg	we used to use this method for determining the sex of an unborn baby many years ago...instead of yes and no it was girl or boy 
tg	I mean no, not having problems. 
tg	Do you want us to use the pendulum right now? 
tg	I remember seeing that done....with a needle on a thread over the Mum to be's protruding abdomen. 
tg	yes 
tg	If you have one, sure please try it. 
tg	Ok. 
tg	When starting a dowsing session it is a good idea to start the pendulum moving. 
tg	Start moving the pendulum how? 
tg	If you wait for it to start moving it will take a bit longer. Just don't start by swinging it in a YES or NO direction. Try choosing your READY swing. Off on any angle is fine. It is important to have a clear, concise question in mind before you start. Otherwise your pendulum may move erratically and you don't know what it means. 
tg	I've had that happen to me when I'm tired. 
tg	It is probably responding ,through your involuntary muscle movement, to any incoming messages from your intuition. 
tg	In fact, it is a good sign. It is probably telling you it's time to stop. LOL 
tg	lol 
tg	lol 
tg	lol 
tg	I programmed the responses and got it swinging ,'ready', and as soon as I asked the question it came to an abrupt stop Maybe I am afraid of the answer and am blocking it? 
tg	Do any of you have a problem sometimes in that the pendulum refuses to move? 
tg	Wow, you read my mind 
tg	Once in the two weeks I've been using. 
tg	You are probably concentrating on watching the pendulum too much. 
tg	I'll try your peripheral suggestion from earlier. 
tg	Your goal is to enjoy yourself and not to take it all too seriously. 
tg	But I know it is hard because the answer is important to you or you wouldn't be asking it 
tg	how much can the pendulum be influenced by our desires? 
tg	One thing you can do is to write YES on one piece of paper and NO on another. Turn them over and shuffle them so you don't know which is which. It can definitely be influenced by your desires. Especially if the question is very personal or emotional. 
tg	after a while though you can get beyond that though right? 
tg	That's also a good time to use the turned over papers. What you do is hold the pendulum over 1 piece of paper and ask... 
tg	sounds very logical to me 
tg	'Is the answer to my question written on this piece of paper?' 
tg	If you get a YES response then turn over the paper and accept whatever is written on it as the correct answer. 
tg	I like that. 
tg	If you get a NO, repeat over the other piece of paper. 
tg	cool, a new trick 
tg	If you get another NO it may be that your question needs to be rephrased. 
tg	Or, you may want to stop for awhile and try again later. 
tg	is going to 'play' tonight
tg	Yes, I like this method...especially when you want the answer to be a certain response. 
tg	yes I guess that's how I wanted my question phrased lol 
tg	It stops you from influencing the swing of the pendulum. 
tg	Please don't get discouraged when you're having any problems. 
tg	It takes a lot of practice before you get confident in your abilities. 
tg	or panic and call your 'guru' lol 
tg	lol 
tg	lol 
tg	lol 
tg	Would anyone like an example of a question that could be worded better? 
tg	please 
tg	please 
tg	Say you wanted to know whether you should take Vitamin D. You might then ask 'Will it be beneficial for me to take Vitamin D?' You get a positive response. But maybe you shouldn't run out and buy some Vitamin D...If you ask 'Do I have a deficiency in Vitamin D?' you would get a NO ,in this example, 
tg	makes sense 
tg	So although it would be beneficial to take it you don't really need it. 
tg	wording is everything 
tg	Here's where using a chart comes in handy. 
tg	please explain? 
tg	what kind of chart? 
tg	I have an article published on About... with an example of a chart. 
tg	It is simply a half circle... 
tg	do you have the url handy? 
tg	brb 
tg	thank you Diane 
tg	thanks Diane 
tg	Thanks Diane 
tg	I am afraid I have to log off now. I've really enjoyed this introduction to beginners and I will persevere with my petulant pendulum. Thanks Diane. Bye everyone. 
tg	It is a bit hard to explain in words...can you all flip to the article? 
tg	love and light Doris, come back soon 
tg	may you walk in balance, beauty and love doris..thanks for coming by 
tg	Thanks and love , light, and  laughter to you all. 
tg	Using the chart you would ask 'Please indicate on a percentage scale how important it is that I take Vitamin D.' 
tg	Based on this example you would get a low percentage. 
tg	I think I've seen these in some books with different topics on them. 
tg	so have I Pooky 
tg	So you may want to hand draw a little chart and take it on your next trip to the health food store. Along with your pendulum, that is.  
tg	It goes where I go. 
tg	Yes, there are a few books on dowsing that have charts. A good one is Pendulum Charts by Dale Olson. 
tg	yes mine too 
tg	His charts are laminated so they hold up well. And the book is spiral bound so it lays flat. 
tg	Well...I think we covered a lot... any questions? 
tg	Sorry I am going to have to bow out, my granddaughter will be here soon and I will have to help her get to bed. Diane this was so interesting, thanks so very much for your time. 
tg	I have one from UniHOST 
tg	Bye...thanks for your input 
tg	UniLady says how would you determine length of time or distance 
tg	For time or distance... 
tg	You can ask in chunks. Say you wanted to know how deep to drill a well... 
tg	You would begin by saying 'Is the water source located at more than 100 feet?' 
tg	' If no...then'...at more than 250 feet?' If Yes...then'at more than 275 feet?' ...265' '...260' and so on until you get the exact figure. 
tg	I have uni on im btw..she is very disappointed that she couldn't get in and I am transcribing to her as we go. UniLady says thank you for stating my feelings to the room 
tg	again it makes perfect sense to me 
tg	That's the best thing about this, it is straightforward 
tg	You would do the same for time...just keep asking if more than.... until you get a NO. Then backtrack. 
tg	Diane, do you have a web site that you would like to share with us? 
tg	That was a bit disjointed...did I make any sense? LOL 
tg	perfect sense. 
tg	perfect sense to me 
tg	Yes I do. It is The Healing Spectrum at www.thehealingspectrum.com 
tg	ty, I'll be checking it out. 
tg	this has been most informative and I would like to thank you soo much for sharing your knowledge with us 
tg	I plan to completely revamp my site one of these days. I'm also very interested in the Seth books by Jane Roberts and want to devote some pages of my site to that. There's never enough time to do everything, eh? 
tg	lol nope 
tg	Have you read Kryon books? 
tg	Thank you..you are very welcome. If anyone has any further questions please feel free to email me
tg	ty

tg	night
tg	First I would like to thanks candy for inviting here. 
tg	Once Thomas is done with what he is sharing at first then we will have question and answers time ok? 
tg	I am thomas Oates 
tg	I had CFIDS from 1989 to 1993 and now I am completely well. When I cam down with it I was selling Life Insurance in TN and now I am a filmmaker in Seattle. I have written several articles, a manuscript on how I healed and produced films that create peace within people. So I know how to find My healing path.....and I think I can help you all find yours. 
tg	cool 
tg	Your path will different however, the dynamics and questions that need to be asked will be the same. First of I wonder how many of have considered the differance between healing and getting well or being 'cured'  
tg	y 
tg	show of hands.. 
tg	y 
tg	y 
tg	y 
tg	y 
tg	cool 
tg	WAVING 
tg	y 
tg	hands 
tg	y 
tg	well I was a little slow, it took me about 3 years of being an invalid before I started to think about the differance 
tg	y 
tg	ok 
tg	How many of you are secretly still trying to find a pill or doctor that will cure you? you don't have to answer
tg	me 
tg	me me 
tg	nope they don't have the cure 
tg	ditto 
tg	there is nothing wrong with that as long as it's not your primary hope 
tg	part of the picture 
tg	For me healing involved a complete resignation to my predicament and then a surrender to my heart in the moment 
tg	agree Morri 
tg	Gettng to this place of complete surrender was the hard part. My ego had to be completely cut down to size. It was obviously very painful in an ego suffering kind of way. But I got there, there was a great peace. A peace so powerful and overwhelming that it was like tuching the edge of some amazing state of grace It was beautiful and I knew that I would healsomeday. I did not care when. I just knew that eventually I would 
tg	wow 
tg	how did you accomplish this? 
tg	i need peace badly 
tg	that is the big question 
tg	Seeking this path of peace is the foundation for all healing. Re aligning our qustions and priorities is how we find our own healing paths. Instead of asking what pill can I take, ask questions that will engage your heart and spirit in the moment 
tg	so the question is as important as the answer? 
tg	the question is infinantly more important than the answer...our spirits, and thus our lives and healing path are directed by the questions we ask..so asking what pill can I take is kind of a dead end. but asking how may I use my limited energy in a joyful creative way?is very healing 
tg	ask, What is it I want to do now....is it painting? Writing a story. something creative that engages your heart and mind and body in the present moment. for me it was photography. 
tg	oops 
tg	he will be back, he was having trouble with that computer 
tg	I also feel starngly drawn to photography 
tg	might be something to explore Obsidian 
tg	ok 
tg	any way where was I? Could someone cut and paste my last line 
tg	for me it was photography 
tg	ty 
tg	The point it to find that joyful activity that engaged you in the creative monent this brings us to the presesnt. Healing happens in the present. If we are worried or stressed or fearful we are not in the healing present 
tg	my brain's so confused i wouldnt even no what I like 
tg	but many people have no idea what it is they love to do ... creatively 
tg	exactly, so we have to back up. how can you figure out what it is you like or love to do? This brings me to step one of my 12 steps to finding your healing path. We spend tooo much time thinking about how we are NOT energized. we use all we have 
tg	y 
tg	thomas is this a 12 step program? 
tg	Here Are 12 Concrete Things that I did every day that allowed me to reach a state that removed the roadblocks from my healing path. 1. Keeping A Journal I kept a daily journal of what I did and how I felt physically, emotionally and mentally. I recorded my dreams consistently and reviewed them every few months to look for recurring themes, ideas, advice. A journal also helped identify what I had done earlier that caused a relapse. It was always a delayed reaction for me.   I would feel better, go out and do something that I thought would help build my strength, and end up deep in the pillow for days after, wondering what happened. The journal sped up the learning curve and helped me to identify energy drains. 
tg	i don't remeber my dreams 
tg	the journal is to your healing path like the hub of a wheel is to the spokes 
tg	how may of keep a journal? 
tg	of sorts 
tg	I do 
tg	no 
tg	not I any more 
tg	no 
tg	do you have a site with this information posted on it? 
tg	i do but nt on a regular bases 
tg	no 
tg	I cannot emphasize how important the journal is 
tg	journal of dreams? 
tg	everything 
tg	why 
tg	a journal is useful for many things in addition to this 
tg	ok 
tg	I try but have not been doing good with it lately 
tg	How many time have you had an insight, inspiration or fleeting thought? 
tg	many 
tg	many times 
tg	thought about something and then brushed aside and disregarded it 
tg	especially gardening 
tg	these small fleeting thoughts are your heart speaking 
tg	k 
tg	spending money I really love 
tg	a journal catches these ideas like snapshots 
tg	so in addition to writing a journal we would be wise to read it in a regular way 
tg	yes 
tg	like going over the past week etc 
tg	I kept a journal while I was ill and over time the fleeting though of making films kept comming to me 
tg	without a journal I would not have been able to catch this guidance 
tg	over time the journal does not lie 
tg	Julia Cameron said that only through writing down our story are we able to see who we are 
tg	healing involves finding discovering what we love to do...it is the best medicine...also dreams are an invaluable resource. how may of you remember your dreams? 
tg	I do 
tg	not me 
tg	cool 
tg	all dreams or many,some? 
tg	are all dreams valuable? is what I mean to ask  
tg	few 
tg	angel, do you wake up with an alarm? 
tg	most of them 
tg	maybe a little or some parts of it 
tg	hi kate 
tg	yes 
tg	the alarm is the reason 
tg	Yayish 
tg	i have to 
tg	I don't remember...and I don't use an alarm, or very very seldom remember 
tg	how about dogs waking you up would that be the same as alarm 
tg	one we begin to ask question before we go to sleep and ask to be guided then our dreams become a powerful resource 
tg	i don't know, do you remember your dreams 
tg	most of the time but not always 
tg	good 
tg	it is the interpreting that is hard part 
tg	so the point is that these dreams, fleeting ideas etc. need to be captured 
tg	i agree yayish 
tg	always puzzling 
tg	even nightmares count huh? 
tg	over time the information in your journal will have common themes 
tg	I don't think you need to interpret...just be aware of common threads or themes 
tg	oops 
tg	what do the themes tell us 
tg	yes 
tg	especially if you ask healing question 
tg	like.. 
tg	How may I use the energy I have in a joyful way 
tg	good one 
tg	how may I use the energy I have in a creative and heartflet, joyful way 
tg	but some nightmares dreams are also cause by lets say some event u saw during day... perhaps movie. 
tg	not How can I get well, this is self pitying 
tg	you wouldn't get a answer from that 
tg	thomas that is a cultural thing for some people 
tg	I think that would also be part of the puzzle...still write it down 
tg	darn 
tg	ut oh..not just me that peabody likes 
tg	he will be back 
tg	hb thomas lol 
tg	huh???? 
tg	booted? 
tg	frustrating eh??? 
tg	recess? 
tg	i agree lightbr, some things even from movies tell us something 
tg	yup 
tg	chanting here thomas 
tg	welcome jera 
tg	mm 
tg	hi Jera 
tg	hi Jera 
tg	love and light to you 
tg	blessings jera welcome to healing 
tg	hi jera 
tg	one dream will not give you all that you are seeking...you have to see the theme 
tg	we are waiting for Mr. Oates to get back in jera 
tg	what kinds of things should we write down during the day? 
tg	now who is this 'Thomas Oates' fellow, and what will he teach? 
tg	yes i want to know too Jera 
tg	12 steps 
tg	I find that things that cause 'emotions'...are the most valuable 
tg	how to reach your own healing path Jera 
tg	sweet 
tg	and important to notice what you 'feel' 
tg	ohhhhh...great 
tg	lol, I will never ay that again 
tg	say even 
tg	he mentions to make note of dreams and little fleeting thoughts, for that is your heart talking, so make a journal 
tg	should we write every event during the day that would be alot? 
tg	this is his website if you want to look around 
tg	cool 
tg	the things that cause you the most emotions...happy, sad, fearful.... 
tg	the things that make you 'wonder' 
tg	ty candy putting in favs now lol 
tg	angel perhaps the significant ones and how it impacted u? 
tg	angel every dream dear,  not everything that happens to you, things that impress you 
tg	what if we have so much stress in our lives 
tg	ditto lightbr 
tg	but we cant get rid of it then what? 
tg	ok 
tg	angel...lots is a matter of 'preception' 
tg	angel that is what you are trying to release by these methods 
tg	sorry my dsl connection is bad 
tg	wb thomas 
tg	so how many of you all want me to continue or would you like to ask question now 
tg	please 
tg	continue 
tg	LOL 
tg	continue 
tg	continue 
tg	i gave them your website while you were gone Tom 
tg	so it's the questions that are so important 
tg	thomas may i just ask do you personally know Nakai 
tg	it is the questions we ask ourselves everyday that direct our spirit 
tg	and therefore our healing paths 
tg	or our healing ruts 
tg	I have met Nakai, He does not know me from Adam 
tg	awe 
tg	lol 
tg	oh all my lols are lots of love 
tg	ok 
tg	listening 
tg	so I guess one of the first things we need to do to get out of our healing ruts is reevaluate how we see our own healing 
tg	are we expecting to be cured or are we seeking to cultivate peace and creative joy in the moment 
tg	there is a huge differance 
tg	?????? 
tg	do you mean find peace and creative joy in our illness?? 
tg	no 
tg	Explain please 
tg	let see.... 
tg	light, what did you enjoy doing in highschool? What hobby? What subject did you enjoy? 
tg	so in turn tha creative joy and peace is what leads to healing of self in the mean time or an avenue to repond well and feel perhaps less stress out about things once we see things lighter than we originally saw it.. 
tg	I don't remember...LOL 
tg	? 
tg	ok 
tg	Healing is peace and peace is healing, for the words are the same. You cannot experience peace without healing. Illness cannot exist where there is peace?  
tg	So when or where do you experience peace? 
tg	Are you talking about spiritual healing and not physical healing?? 
tg	for me its when I am painnting 
tg	EVERYTHING 
tg	i had a dream last wekk that the star in the sky glowed at me and i was smiling in my dream andn felt peace which i had never felt and somone spoke how does this feel 
tg	healing 
tg	so if you do something and it causes pain stay away from it? 
tg	So are you saying that when we find inner peace...we will not be ill?? A little confused...sorry 
tg	peace is experienced when we are engaged in the present moment 
tg	yes rainbow 
tg	in a sense light 
tg	I know that disease is a teacher....but...have trouble bringing it to the next step 
tg	there is a place of such profound peace and joy that if you were there but your body was still ill, you would not care 
tg	Ok...I can understand that 
tg	oh been there 
tg	you would be so joyful and filled with peace that your illness would be of no consequence 
tg	this is what happened to me 
tg	Ok...can understand that 
tg	but thomas one doesn't stay there continully 
tg	you don't need to 
tg	true 
tg	well then I'm healed 
tg	mm 
tg	just knowing that it is there changes how you view everything 
tg	what of those illness forces you to leave behind, thomas? you have children? the peace surpasses that? 
tg	very good 
tg	does that really work when having to integrate to life in this world, and how hard is it to keep up that kind of energy without having a horrible crash from time to time? 
tg	real life does take away from it 
tg	I thought so 
tg	but it takes no energy to be there... 
tg	where? 
tg	It takes 'letting go'...a lot 
tg	to maintain there is what I was questioning 
tg	if you are struggling to have peace in your life you are on the wrong track, cultivating peace is about letting go 
tg	oh thats me 
tg	how do we let go 
tg	where your heart knows where. 
tg	the idea then is to come to a place of such peace that the illness and earthly things are of no consequence? 
tg	angel...letting go of the things that are causing you all that stress you talked about 
tg	ask before you go to sleep 
tg	you let go by no longer iving the negitive aspect of the situation any energy 
tg	peace is the symptom of having completely resigned to your predicament and surrendering to your heart. Peace is the symptom of being on yourhealing path  
tg	I see no evolution in that tom 
tg	what if im dealing with my cfs, can't wor,k just found out my son has autism, my rent went up and I'm to sick to move and my ex won't give me more money and his girlfriend is getting violent... then what? 
tg	Ahhh...but we are so resistent some times... 
tg	please don't be condescending 
tg	when faced with a choice and the its between something that feels like a struggle and not struggle which way are you going to go? 
tg	Obsidian....explain..evolution in what? 
tg	so I should just give up trying to get better, and say this is where I am and this is where I will always be... 
tg	ahhhhhh 
tg	but resignation, surrender does not equal giving up 
tg	big difference 
tg	I tell you what if I had done that I'd be dead by now 
tg	Resignation is giving in, not giving up. We resign and surrender to our hearts joy... resign to to our situation and surrender to our hearts. Does that make sense? 
tg	thomas are your 12 stp parallel to the 12 step AA program by your suggestion of surrendering 
tg	I suffer mental illness. I have resigned the fact that I have mental illness  
tg	maybe, I am not familiar with the AA 12 steps 
tg	this is only a first step along this journey of wellness 
tg	I also have to do something active to bring about change and healing 
tg	thomas do you work with people online or on phone? 
tg	I believe we all do 
tg	you believe in the prayer God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference 
tg	y 
tg	that's it 
tg	thats part of the 12 step progam thomas 
tg	ok 
tg	Let go of the need to 'control' what is happening?? 
tg	healing involves change, and people had almost rather die than change  
tg	do you have your interuption of the 12 step program posted 
tg	thomas dp you work one on one with people on phone? 
tg	my 12 steps are, one sec I will post the url 
tg	I would be happy to help any one...206 216 0720 
tg	let's try to remember that thomas is speaking of healing in regards to dealing with CFS folks 
tg	yes I am not a doctor. therapist, but I have help a lot of people  
tg	but this can also be used in healing with anything 
tg	yes, healing is healing, the dynamics of it is the same  
tg	are there any other questions? 
tg	what is CFS, chronic fatigue? 
tg	Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
tg	What if we only remember bits and pieces of our dreams? 
tg	angel then those are the ones that are important 
tg	but can't remeber the whole dream tho 
tg	the more you foccus on them and seek to understand them the more you will begin to remember 
tg	thomas are the steps..or the 'place of peace' akin to meditation? 
tg	it's truely amazing the information we have access to in our dreams 
tg	why can't we ask how can we get better? 
tg	it's the point of meditation to get there, I am just a really bad meditator 
tg	ok...thank you very much 
tg	Painting is my meditation 
tg	during dreams is the only time our mind is quiet enough for spirit to come through to help us 
tg	the videos I produce shift you from stress to peace 
tg	thomas what if we can't get rid of the stressors in our life right now 
tg	ok. things change 
tg	ty 
tg	you will not always have these stressors and when the opportunity arrives make a differant choice 
tg	also be VERY weary of the word CAN'T 
tg	ok so even if we still have then it will help to find the peace that we are looking for 
tg	even if you can shift the stress for small amounts of time when you are able, it will add to healing right? 
tg	for obsidian, the difference is between having a terminal diagnosis and a diagnosis that you must learn to live with 
tg	yyy 
tg	yes guest 
tg	can't implies that we have no choice 
tg	ditto Guest ty 
tg	this is a very dangerious thought 
tg	we all are born with free will 
tg	when we deny ourself the right of choice by saying 'I can't ' we are inviting god to completely destroy our live until we see that yes indeed we have a choice 
tg	And because we have free will...we can only get help from the universe if we ask... 
tg	it is the rule number 1....we all have infinite choices in every moment 
tg	please do not forget this 
tg	so then in chosing to not accept the diagnosis that i would never walk again...i wasn't fighting my illness i was using free will when i got out of the chair? 
tg	charles dubois said, the important thing is being willing at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become 
tg	we may not like the choices but they are there 
tg	that would depend on you intention. 
tg	there is a reason for every thing 
tg	do you find the best choices are usually the hard choices? 
tg	trying to understand..because i walk today because i fight my illness and don't give in to it 
tg	but that is my choice to do so 
tg	that's where the confusion comes in...are we choosing to be ill with our CFS?? 
tg	very good 
tg	very hard to understand Morrigan but the accepting part is what we fight 
tg	you are fighting yourself then as you aren't seperate from illness 
tg	I must really be being resistant with this concept 
tg	oh boy...not conciously. I certainly did not choose it 10 years ago 
tg	it is like if you got a speeding ticket in a forign country because you did not understand the road signs you still get put in jail. But you may say 'I can't read chinese' That does not matter.  
tg	what causes CFS? 
tg	So maybe I'm not reading the signs of the lesson I'm to learn from this illness?? 
tg	this is also a Cultural thing 
tg	we are governed by universal laws 
tg	when we live out of harmony with them . we become sick, we are thrown in jail 
tg	right...I agree...so I'm out of harmony...out of balance....blocked in some way?? 
tg	just because we are not aware of them does not excuse us from living within them 
tg	It's filling some purpose?? 
tg	individual culturals look at illness in many different ways 
tg	illness serves the ill in some way 
tg	healing also involves seeing how we are living out of balance and correcting the imbalances, thus moving back into harmony with life. Wholeness 
tg	So if I ask for help...and keep a journal...then some common theme will come through?? 
tg	yyy 
tg	hummm 
tg	guarantee it 
tg	it's the acceptance of what we look like and how we do things via palsy or mental illness or just pain 
tg	it must be a heartfelt asking 
tg	can i ask how to find the peace? 
tg	ok...next...if I find the theme....purpose...how do I get over the resistance to change this?? 
tg	I don't understand your question rainbow 
tg	sure 
tg	how to find peace... 
tg	um 
tg	that dream last week felt so good when I had peace for that 1 minute in my dream 
tg	Peace is a symptom not a goal. We experience peace when we are present 
tg	thomas my ? is do you see it in individuals who see things in a cultural way some can't accept all the same way 
tg	a symptom of balance 
tg	it is most easily experienced when we do something creative and joyful in the moment 
tg	I am not advocating any 'one way' peace if cultivated by following our own hearts path. Where that leads you is your path. 
tg	so if i understand correctly, we will be at peace when we give our energy to joyful things instead of things that bring us pain or stress 
tg	yyy...like trading 
tg	Can you address 'resistance'...even if we find the thread, lesson, etc...how do we get over the resistance 
tg	resistance...umm..thats a tuffy 
tg	yes...I find I have very strong resistance... 
tg	I think it must be fear related 
tg	could be 
tg	healing involves change 
tg	the fear of feeling better? 
tg	resistance for me personally revolves around fear 
tg	and people would rather die than change...the ego dies hard 
tg	the fear of changing, letting go of illness, as illness serves the ill 
tg	soooo...how do you address that...trick your ego....change it??? 
tg	it's just change. it's hard...letting go of an old life. it's like a death in the family 
tg	are there techniques?? 
tg	man I just got to the point where I would do anything in order to heal 
tg	all of my energy, focus, strength revolved around letting go of struggle and cultivating peace 
tg	lightbr like he says finds an incentive.. how does 'healing' sound as an incentive... will you drop the resistence for that goal?. 
tg	y 
tg	i have to sleep thanks thomas that was great 
tg	If I haven't done it by now...it is obviously to me that I must have tremendous resistance 
tg	love and light to you Angel 
tg	we all do 
tg	love and light to all of you 
tg	out u don't believe it could happen 
tg	good night angel thanks for listening 
tg	Oh...I have great belief...but something stops me from doing it 
tg	I have 3 uninvited guests,  fear, jealousy, love 
tg	beliefs don't heal.....questions that direct our spirit and lives heal 
tg	questions?? 
tg	but u even said.. ask like u truly mean it.. from the heart.. and for that to happen for u truly to mean it u must belief that is all possible... 
tg	ask how you may use the energy you have in a joyful creative way? and see what happens to your life 
tg	y 
tg	I have written that down...and will surely try it 
tg	ask over and over. 
tg	the answer is out there 
tg	yes...I know that spirit does not work on my time frame..LOL 
tg	there is nothing but a great hope 
tg	yes unfortunately it's none of our ego's business when we heal 
tg	LOL...true 
tg	well it has got to be getting pretty late on the east coast 
tg	You know...I even am resistant about keeping a journal...so much resistance to healing...geezzz 
tg	I would be happy to talk to anyone .... 
tg	tis about 1115 here 
tg	light it's ok, someday you will heal.. 
tg	The Yankees lost...and sat. night live is not on yet...LOL 
tg	yankees lost. cool 
tg	ligh the good thing is you know you have the resistance and admit to it 
tg	thank you so much for your time and energy thomas

tg	thanks good night. 
tg	howdy Jackie....blessings to you 
tg	Hi Tao 
tg	welcome to our chat....how are you this evening? 
tg	thank you for the invitation 
tg	it's great to have you here, Jackie....I'm sure all will find great benefit from your sharing 
tg	Welcome to healing,newage chat  
tg	This evening is devoted to our guest host, author Jackie Woods..she has a lot to share that can be helpful....we are fortunate to have her here 
tg	I'd like to welcome Jackie Woods, our guest for chat this evening....thanks for being here Jackie 
tg	Thank you Tao 
tg	Jackie is the author of the book, Spiritual Energy Cycles 
tg	Jackie, could you give us a little background about your Path, and what led to the book? 
tg	My path has been guided by spirit guides and angels. Sometimes that has been etheric and sometimes they have manifested into the physical... 
tg	for example...one time I was guided to get a message from a psychic lady but I didn't know how to get there. So I started out with the help of my spirit guides....got to the place where she worked and realized that it was a huge apartment complex...and I freaked, how was I going to find her when I didn't have an address? 
tg	I pulled over to the side of the road...and when I looked up there was a shiny blue old ford pick up with a young blonde long haired man sitting beside me...he asked if he could help and I said 'Do you know where I could find a psychic lady in this complex?'
tg	He replied that he could and he did. I turned around and he had vanished...no motors or driving away just vanished... 
tg	great example of practical spirituality 
tg	when I heard from the psychic lady that it had been archangel Michael that had directed me there I understood. 
tg	a wonderful gift, Jackie....and a blessing to be chosen in that manner 
tg	This experience and many more like it directed me to the path that I am now on... 
tg	Yes, I am a little envious 
tg	It is a path of bringing spiritual truth into physical reality...basically, that's what the book is about. 
tg	Your book is about spiritual energy cycles....could you speak a bit about your awareness of energy? 
tg	I was trained by an etheric Indian in the use of energy... 
tg	I could always see it from the time I was born...and the Indian taught me how to work with it. 
tg	another blessing....and indication of being prepared 
tg	swell 
tg	could you share your understanding of energy as it relates to our spiritual growth? 
tg	Energy is the fabric of the universe...all that we are is just that generic universal energy channeled through definitions... 
tg	are these definitions our choices? 
tg	Growth is just about changing your definitions, which you couldn't see or work with if there was no energy running through them..like a balloon with no air in it. 
tg	Yes, the definitions are our choices. Do you want further explanation? 
tg	  
tg	yes please 
tg	please define definitions 
tg	We can choose to define from our heart or from our programming... The definition is just the structure of how our heart energy is going to manifest into the world. 
tg	definition is thought? 
tg	Here's an example, My grandmother's definition of love is feeding me big meals...that's how her love expresses different from universal love... 
tg	lol 
tg	now, did that definition come from her parents? Did she think it up herself? Does it matter? 
tg	It's the programming that's in there...is that clear? 
tg	yes 
tg	so you should change programming? 
tg	what's it got to do with spiritual growth? 
tg	You should check to see if your programming comes from your heart. 
tg	so if you told her you were not hungry, would she feel rejected?.... I'm wondering how fragile the definition of love might be for a person 
tg	And if it doesn't then you should change. 
tg	could you share your understanding of emotion in the process of growth? 
tg	Definitions that are not from the heart tend to be fragile... 
tg	Tao, the emotion tells us that we are responding to our physical world...they tell us we have a need...and that need is the heart energy, which then can define how that need can be met..that's it 
tg	you mentioned in the book that all is energy....could you share a bit about interaction, personally and globally? 
tg	Since each vibration that you have within you resonates with that same vibration in others, raising your vibration helps them raise theirs. 
tg	Wow 
tg	so this happens even when we are not consciously aware of others 
tg	This happens in a one on one basis but it also happens all over the globe. In the world of energy there is no time or space 
tg	Yes Tao 
tg	so for people to make a contribution to the planet, they can do so by choosing to grow spiritually....defining through the heart 
tg	Whenever one candle burns brighter the whole earth is a little bit brighter. 
tg	another way to describe or understand oneness? 
tg	dim to bright... good idea 
tg	yes that is oneness. 
tg	I was really interested in the process of growth you described in the book....could you take us through the steps? 
tg	unity 
tg	so if ones life is very dim the one who holds more brightness can help the other 
tg	It all starts with the emotion...a physical happening brings up a feeling and if we stay with that feeling without trying to solve it or fix it..it will take us to the need of our heart. 
tg	'Need' is not something that we don't have and have to go find. It's something we do have that needs to be expressed. When we realize this, we've grown in that area and we're ready for the second part of the cycle...manifestation. 
tg	Since the need was a heart energy...that heart energy will need to be defined so that is can express in the physical world as a manifestation. As soon as we manifest, it brings up a feeling, and the whole cycle starts over again. 
tg	before we continue, I'd like to ask for questions on this so far... 
tg	Do you need to be aware of this growth process or does it just happen naturally? 
tg	so if we want to change jobs, and we get the energy is expansion that needs expression. what do we do next? 
tg	Terri, it certainly helps to be aware Your lessons will come up even if you're not aware...but awareness makes it possible for you to consciously move through the lesson. 
tg	Cole,get to know that energy in you as something more than a word.  
tg	how do I do that? 
tg	When you've lived with that energy for awhile and can describe its smell, taste, and size...then it will define through you, opening all kinds of doors. 
tg	oh 
tg	any other questions before we continue? 
tg	am I understanding 'need' as a yearning or longing to become? 
tg	XXX, a longing to express what you've already become. 
tg	does the expression lead to a feeling of completeness? 
tg	Does this mean that we already have the energy? 
tg	XXX, the expression is about flow...flow of who we are into the world and usually there is fulfillment in that but it doesn't guarantee that the world is going to like it. 
tg	as a energy ? 
tg	669, yes. you already are everything you need. 
tg	wow 
tg	there is a great comfort in that statement Jackie 'you are already everything you need'  thank you 
tg	Jackie, you talked in the book about the chakras....how does working on a chakra reach the areas of our 'blocks' or 'untruths?' 
tg	we have what we need but need to know how to use it? 
tg	Tao, chakra is just a concentration of energy at a certain vibration and our blocks can center around different vibrations. for example, if we have trouble accepting money into our lives, our blocks are centered around the physical chakra..whereas, if we are a caretaker, our blocks center around the emotional chakra. 
tg	Kokom, growth is not about piling more stuff on your plate...it's about scraping stuff off to see the plate... 
tg	you already know how to use it if you can get past the untruths that tell you you can't or shouldn't. Is that clear?  
tg	oh I see thinking the opposite I guess 
tg	jes 
tg	yes jackie ty 
tg	What you shared in your book implied the need for a sense of discipline in some manner. Could you speak about that in terms of personal responsibility VS waiting for the world to meet our needs,expectations? 
tg	Tao, we create our lessons constantly but the rate we create them depends on the rate that we are consciously growing. We are the creator of what we see in the world. When the world brings it to us to look at, that's really us that created that. 
tg	and if we allow the habitual within us to continue to be dominant? 
tg	why would we want to bring more lessons to ourselves 
tg	Whether we have chaos or calm in our life situations has to do with our own creation of experiences. Jackie? 
tg	If we let the patterns rule, we're missing an opportunity, for after all, the reason we're here is to grow. 
tg	Jamie, growth is just learning. Lessons are just something to learn. 
tg	so while incarnate, growth,lessons are unending 
tg	Lila, chaos or calm depends on whether we are responding to life in emotional reaction or if we are directing the emotions to the heart. 
tg	Tao, yes, and afterwards also. 
tg	when directing emotions to the heart, is that similar to what some might term transmutation? 
tg	Tao, it's not transmutation so much as looking through a different pair of eyes. 
tg	ah....ty 
tg	could you share your understanding of breath as a tool for working with our energy? 
tg	do you think that sometimes we are given lessons over again so we may see them in another way? 
tg	chaos is losing your new eye glasses.... lol 
tg	Tao, the breath is a carrier of energy, and it's very important of keeping the flow of energy.. 
tg	whether it is in the growth side of the cycle, or the manifestation side. 
tg	WhitehorseWoman, lessons are like layers of an onion. We take off a layer at a time as we are able to grow up that heart energy. 
tg	How can you retrain your emotions to look toward the heart? 
tg	Bananas, good question. It is a matter of focus. If our focus stays on the outside happenings, our emotions will react. If our focus stays on the heart, our emotions will direct. 
tg	is it correct to say that breath changes the vibration of our conscious awareness? 
tg	Tao, not by itself. It's just a tool  
tg	accompanied by intent 
tg	The intent of the heart changes things. We have many intents. There is the intent of our emotions, of our mind, and of our physical habits. These must have a voice over of the heart for the intent to have power.  
tg	Could you rephrase that last comment, Jackie, about the voice over? just looking for a synonym 
tg	How can we tell the difference between the intent of our heart and either the body or mind or emotions? 
tg	The heart must be the guiding voice. 
tg	Bananas, it takes practice to distinguish the different voices within you. Journaling and meditation are great tools. 
tg	I imagine that the guiding voice of your heart can be confused with desires that may not be advantageous to spiritual growth 
tg	What is true power? Is there real power when we create a lesson when NOT being in our heart? David 
tg	Yes Lila, that is so true 
tg	919, our heart creates all of our lessons. But our free will may choose to ignore the lesson. 
tg	while energy circulates through our being, could you talk about maintaining balance, as in male,female or giving,receiving 
tg	Tao, getting out of balance is just about losing trust or faith. Too little trust, and your male is out of balance. Too little faith, and the female loses her voice in the process. 
tg	the most powerful energy comes from our feelings, that is why love is so very important and why we must constantly stay in a place of love. 
tg	Both the male and the female must have an equal part in the process to maintain balance. The male is the giving, the female the receiving. 
tg	One more question Tao and then I have to go. 
tg	Could you speak about your understanding of giving and receiving, and how that relates to creating abundance?....am thinking about practical explanation 
tg	Tao, Lack is just about not having a healthy giving and receiving cycle... 
tg	when we give an energy, surrounded by fear it can only come back small. When we give an energy surrounded by abundance, or expansion, or flow, etc. then it can come back big. 
tg	Much of what is being said here I read on Jackie's website Thank You, Jackie 
tg	then you would say conditional giving of energy is based in fear? 
tg	Thanks Terri 
tg	Lila, yes. 
tg	Thanks, Jackie 
tg	like saying I'll rub your back if you rub mine isn't really giving of yourself 
tg	thank you, Jackie 
tg	Thanks Lila, yes 
tg	thanks jackie 
tg	Jackie, I don't wish to keep you from your other committments....thank you for being here and for all you shared....blessings to you....

tg	what is the web site address again? 
tg	yes thank you tao 
tg	again, the name of Jackie's book is, Spiritual Energy Cycles by Jackie Woods 
tg	first i would like to welcome stephen today to our chat 
tg	Thanks for having me 
tg	a warm welcome to you Stephen 
tg	Thank you. My pleasure. 
tg	if you could, stephen, give us a brief intro into the work you do 
tg	I use past life regression to help others find the root cause of problems and then release those problems. My main area is love lives. I'm also a Reiki Master teacer 
tg	Welcom, KariAnn 
tg	how did you get started in this field? 
tg	Hello Everyone
tg	I've been fascinated with metaphysics since I was very young and read everything I could find on the subjects. After my first regression at age 20 I was hooked 
tg	Do you have any insight as to why so many people find Letting go more difficult than remaining in a toxic relationship? 
tg	Sometimes it's because they're afraid of being alone. They fear that if they leave the toxic person that they will not find anyone better. Also, past life guilt can cause someone to hang onto a toxic lover, the abused may have been the abuser in a past life. Or, the abused may subconsciously remember a past life with the abused where it was harmonious, so they hold on hoping the abuser will change. 
tg	When a couple is involved in an unhappy or difficult relationship are there certain signs to watch for which could indicate whether they are involved in paying back negative karma or actually creating negative karma? 
tg	If you are in a relationship where it seems you are stuck and have no choice but sacrifice yourself in some way, even if you don't want to, it may mean you are paying back negative karma. Your soul created the situation so your personality would be forced to go through the experience. We create negative love karma when we react out of fear , anger, jealousy, greed etc, instead of love. 
tg	is there any way to make this process go faster 
tg	FORGIVE Forgive yourself and everyone involved. Finding the root cause through past life regression or meditation helps a lot too. 
tg	Forgivness is essential to happiness 
tg	so maybe forgive and love combined are the keys? 
tg	YES 
tg	Could you explain what you mean in your book about it being what you don't do that creates harmonious relationships? 
tg	We tend to get in the way of our relationships. When we have no expectations, no conditions, and refrain from projecting and controlling, and instead love and accept each other unconditionally, our relationships are much more harmonious. 
tg	so accepting each other as we are without trying to make another into what we desire is key 
tg	Yes, but that's easier said then done, of course 
tg	How can the work you do on yourself change your partner? 
tg	By working through your own relationship issues and whatever bothers you about your partner, you'll react differently to him or her, which will in turn change how he or she reacts to you. Accepting and forgiving him or her are important if you want to create more harmony between you. 
tg	have you found that usually the issues we have with others are really our own issues 
tg	Absolutely. We are all mirrors for each other. Some people, depending upon the dymamics,energy between the couple, are even more so for each other 
tg	so when another triggers some emotions, is it our job to discover the root of that emotion and work on it? 
tg	takes a magnifying mirror for us to see ourselves clearly sometimes... huh? 
tg	Yes. We can ignore it, or we can face it. 
tg	How can the subconscious mind overpower the conscious mind? 
tg	Yes, other people are our mirrors 
tg	Our subconscious mind is our 'control center.' Even if we consciously know that flying is relatively safe, if our subconscious mind has a fear of flying from past life experiences, you will be afraid of flying. Likewise, if you have hidden relationship blocks in your subconscious mind, you will experience conflict in that area of your life. If your subconscious mind thinks, based on past life experience, that all relationsh, msg continues in 20 secs 
tg	ips end in pain and heartache, that's what your reality will present to you. You have the option of changing false beliefs through past life self regression. msg complete 
tg	so would you say that finding out what the subconscious mind is thinking will help us to better understand why our relationships are as they are 
tg	Yes, WH. You can start by asking , over and over if necessary, why something affects you like it does. Eventually you'll discover the ROOT cause. 
tg	When it comes to sexual orientation, could there be more than karmic issues that causes one to desire one sex over the other or to desire both sexes? 
tg	Yes, many issues seem to contribute to sexual orientation, but most of these issues seem karmic. However, not in a punishment kind of way. Sometimes the body's sexual orientation is simply part of the package the soul chose and there is no karma associated with it. 
tg	Some say that everything is karmic, or nothing is karmic and that there is no in between 
tg	i would like to take this question a bit deeper 
tg	Okay 
tg	do you think that some spirits have evolved to the point where they love spirits rather than bodies 
tg	YES, but I think it begins with looks for everyone because that's what we see first. 
tg	How do our beliefs about sex effect our love life? 
tg	Some are more aware of the energy of a person rather than only the physical shell, if that's what you meant by your last question. 
tg	kinda yes 
tg	ty 
tg	Our beliefs about sex affect our lives very much We're programmed to think that sex is dirty, bad, and wrong. Even if we consciously know better, the feelings of how others influenced us as we grew up are still there. 
tg	so our current life but past history also will effect our relationships 
tg	Yes. For example, what's your reaction when you see a provicatively dressed person? 
tg	parental imprinting seems to have just as much effect as karma in our relationships it seems 
tg	Many people will say to themselves, 'slut' 
tg	yep, my thoughts,lol 
tg	Absolutely, that's part of the puzzle 
tg	i always think.........wish i could get away with that 
tg	hahhahahaha 
tg	lol 
tg	lol 
tg	LOL me too 
tg	age is showing i think 
tg	I'm sure that is where the resentment comes from 
tg	Yeah 
tg	but i understand the point you are trying to make 
tg	If you do not believe in reincarnation how can past life regressions help you 
tg	By pretending we live past lives. It really doesn't matter if reincarnation is true or not because regression provides a unique system to package a problem or fear and the release it. 
tg	can one regress with oneself, or should there be a mediator to monitor them and guide the regressor? 
tg	Yes, MM, we can regress ourselves. I feel it's as safe as meditation, which is as safe as day dreaming. I give several scripts in my book. 
tg	do you mean it is a way to find the root problem no matter if you believe or not because it opens up your mind to the underlying cause? 
tg	Yes, WW, it helps the mind package the problem and then release it 
tg	Do you believe there are some spirits that are reincarnated not because of karmic issues or lessons they need to learn? 
tg	It seems that most of us have some karma or lessons to learn, but some souls choose to incarnate mainly to help and assist. This may be on a wide scale as in helping or enlightening the masses, or on a smaller scale as in raising a child. 
tg	would you like to share your website with the room 
tg	to assist would be a lesson in itself, wouldn't it? 
tg	Sure www.howisyourlovelife.com. 
tg	there is always room to evolve the soul, i believe anyway 
tg	Yes it would, MM 
tg	please if others have question share them with the room 
tg	What you experience while assisting a regression often has something to do with you too 
tg	that mirror thing again 
tg	The bad and the good, others show us all about ourselves. 
tg	is that not true with all forms of healing stephen 
tg	Yes, in my opinion. 
tg	does meditation work as well as past life regression? 
tg	you said we are first attracted to looks, but many meet online, and are attracted first to the soul...does that affect one's ability to love the spirit, not the body? 
tg	It can if you are experienced. PLR is essentially the same but you give the mind more direction to access the past. 
tg	stephen, do you believe in indiscriminate past life regression? or should it be only as issues come up in one's life? 
tg	Yes, Raina. But on line there is MUCH illusion 
tg	How do you mean, Rachel? 
tg	Do you mean allowing what ever to surface, surface? 
tg	what.... we tend to show mostly our good sides online??.... LOL 
tg	in general? 
tg	not me .........shows all sides 
tg	Yes, Lila, and in person too. But online we can only see a small part of the picture 
tg	I think plr is useful as a part of our process when it's around issues in our current life. I don't think it is meant to be used for recreation 
tg	Hahahaha 
tg	well, online you can be whoever u want to be, thats a good and a bad thing ,  if one is deceiving, 
tg	It can be used for recreation. No harm in that. 
tg	recreation? 
tg	How do you decipher the difference between, choosing this lifes karma, and past life karma? 
tg	We choose our current life experiences based on our past life karma, what we need to learn our lessons 
tg	I disagree. A growth path held by your higher self has purpose and focus. Bringing up issues one isn't ready for does not necessarily bring benefit. 
tg	Is that what you meant? 
tg	can we choose karma KariAnn? 
tg	reviewing past lives can be recreational I agree, but would rather view past life info that will assist me in this lifetime 
tg	Rachel, you will not perceive what you are not ready for. 
tg	I agree, Lila 
tg	Morrigan, thats a good question, I remember choosing this life, and remember 
tg	being told if I chose the harder path the bigger the reward. 
tg	I've always watned to do that, i KNow I have a lot of baggage to clear out 
tg	but how to access it is beyond me 
tg	wow KA 
tg	Can we choose karma? We create it. I don't think we can choose it, unless we help someone with their karma 
tg	yes KA, but that was the decision you made before incarnating this time..not one you make now?? 
tg	can you share a simple meditation for viewing your past lives? or is there anything simple? 
tg	Stephen has a book that may help you midnightmessngr, maybe he will be kind enough to post his website again so you can check it out 
tg	how about choosing to payback karma more quickly... that can create a whirlwind catastrophe? 
tg	That would be too much to type here. It's in my book and there is info about that on my site
tg	ok, i saw it earlier, I jsut don't want to lose that chat page right now 
tg	small bites please 
tg	Choosing payback karma? Please explain 
tg	k 
tg	MM clicking on the link won't close your window here 
tg	lila... will you be posting the transcript to this chat somewhere also? 
tg	Morrigan, thats just it, how far back does karma go? 
tg	ok, ty Morrigan 
tg	Karma can go back to our first existance on Earth , or elsewhere, 
tg	yw 
tg	If we are here to balance karma from past life then can't we choose to do it slowly rather than quickly... create karma in 20 years, pay it back in one year, that could be trying 
tg	does that make sense? 
tg	i don't understand payback karma 
tg	Yes... we have free will to do that. 
tg	So when I chose this life, and all the 'stuff' associated with this life, is that karma? 
tg	But sometimes it's not possible to pay it back quickly. That's why forgiveness is so important. Sometimes you can overcome karma simply by forgiving yourself 
tg	ahhhh so that brings up another question.......other places of existance......being another being from another place can also carry lessons we need to understand? 
tg	The stuff is karma, good and bad 
tg	Stephen, could you give raina a definition of karma from your perspective? 
tg	Yes, it can, WH. 
tg	karma to me when it is paid back is like when my daughter stole from me then later on someone stole from her all the money she had 
tg	Karma is cause and effect. What we put out comes back to us 
tg	it was a lesson she needed to learn 
tg	oh ok ty whorsew 
tg	ty 
tg	yw 
tg	That goes for intent too 
tg	oh boy 
tg	I am my own enemy
tg	Forgive yourself whenever you think of it. 
tg	i believe it goes with everything we are.......our walk 
tg	almost every belief system has a form of karma built in..the bible uses 'an ye sow so shall ye reap' for instance 
tg	Yes, M. 
tg	It's a universal law. It applies to EVERYONE no matter what their religion. 
tg	I believe that 'universal' thing 
tg	i also believe it keeps coming back until you understand completely the lesson 
tg	We are energy. 
tg	Yes, WH, I believe that too. 
tg	any other questions for stephen 
tg	Sometimes it takes us a while to get it 
tg	boy do i know that 
tg	darn ISP 
tg	Especially in love relationships... and family 
tg	seems sometimes i can be hard headed about things 
tg	agree whw, the universe likes to reinforce our lessons with refresher courses 
tg	Hahaha 
tg	i would like to thank you stephen for sharing with us today 
tg	so by doing PLR's and getting to the root of what created the mold,rut we may be in...we can change it and find a real love this time Stephen? 
tg	Thanks for having me I offer free meditation instruction on my website, and free love life advice from a karma and reincarnation perspective. 
tg	Stephen I apologize, my ISP has been down 
tg	Hi Candy 
tg	poor candy, you were looking so forward to this chat 
tg	i would also like to mention that stephens twin brother works with numerology , spelling, so his book has lots of great information in it 
tg	Hi Stephen I really enjoyed your book, would like to purchase a few CDs 
tg	Yes, Scott explains in my book that we all have love timing and how to follow it so you know what's coming up 
tg	Thanks Candy 
tg	best book I have read in eons on reincarnation an dlove life 
tg	thank you for sharing your knowledge 
tg	candy do you a some questions for stephen? 
tg	Thank you 
tg	have many friends who want to read it 
tg	You're welcome, snowa 
tg	i gave my copy to a store owner in seattle and she is going to order some copies to sell 
tg	WHW none, the book answered them all 
tg	Thank you WH. 
tg	yw 
tg	cool whw 
tg	i also want to thank all who came to listen and ask their questions today. 
tg	Yes, thanks to all of you for participating 
tg	ty for having us. it was very interesting. 
tg	enjoyed  ty 
tg	now chat is open for anything anyone would like to speak about 
tg	thank you so much for sharing with us Stephen 
tg	and thank you whw for moderating 
tg	You're welcome, M 
tg	no thanks needed as i consider it a treat 
tg	yes whw, good questions 
tg	enjoy it 
tg	thanks raina 
tg	Stephen is still here, ask him whatever you like, he has good answers 
tg	Ask away 
tg	thanks but the answers that I was seeking were in the book 
tg	And within you.
tg	how far is one able to go back into past lives? 
tg	wow Candy..now i REALLY have to get the book
tg	covered things quite clearly for me 
tg	so you think we attract people who will help us learn, even if painfully, lessons we need? 
tg	How far? I've had people go back to Atlantis and Lemuria, 50,000 years 
tg	i believe that the most powerful lessons come through pain we face and walk through 
tg	are you abke to tell if others we know now were with us in past lives? 
tg	Yes, Raina, others are our helpers with our lessons. It comes down to how aware of it do you want to be? With awareness comes understanding, compassion, and forgiveness 
tg	Stephen, do you personally have roots in Atlantis? That subject is interesting 
tg	Yes. Most people you know now you've known before 
tg	Yes, I had many lifetimes in Atlantis, 17 that I know of 
tg	amen Stephen, they keep coming back for dinner...lol 
tg	Hahahaha 
tg	lol 
tg	Have you seen yourself in Atlantis, Lila? 
tg	Do you think people can incarnate immidiately after death? 
tg	no I haven't , but had a friend years ago that had some fantastic stories about her life there 
tg	From what I understand, suicides often come back right away, but most of us take a break. We usually need it 
tg	fascinating 
tg	Many who lived in Atlantis are back now, particularily in the USA 
tg	Most people interested in metaphysics have had at least one life in Atlantis 
tg	is past life regression expensive? 
tg	Some charge a lot for it, over 200 dollars. That's part of the reason I wrote my scripts in the book, so you can do it on your own 
tg	always felt strong ties to Atlantis 
tg	I must get this book 
tg	can you regress a person that 'can't be hypnotized'? 
tg	Yes, M, you can. 
tg	and doing your own is really reliable? it really works? 
tg	good question 
tg	Have no idea of my past lives. 
tg	I've search the akashic records for an Atlantis experience, but didn't come up with one, but then I always use the intention to only review past experiences that will assist me now with such knowledge. 
tg	It may take a little practice, AB, but yes, it works 
tg	well, if your book will teach me how, i am sold, ty. 
tg	Lila, have you ever tried asking your Higher Self to show you an Atlantis lifetime? 
tg	lila just to relive the experience would be wonderous 
tg	do you find that some people get these answers in dreams if they are aware of them? 
tg	Stephen, I haven't, maybe I will sometime 
tg	Absolutely Ask your guides or HS before bed for what you want to perceive and with practice you'll get a lot 
tg	interesting 
tg	I do that each night before I go to bed, I have had great results with dreams 
tg	i find for myself that those things which are hardest for me to face will come to me gently through dreams so that i can face them 
tg	Cool Ask and you shall receive 
tg	hi Guest 
tg	That's great, WH. I find that true for me sometimes too 
tg	My dream life is vivid and prophetic, never thought about tapping into past lives that way. 
tg	i have dreamed things i didn't understand, and i was told these are things i am trying to tell myself of past lives? does this sound possible? 
tg	Could be your past lives, AB 
tg	Oh yes, make sure you ask your Higher Self to make the advice in dreams CLEAR AND OBVIOUS. 
tg	bak 
tg	that would help, huh
tg	wb snowa 
tg	ty 
tg	a new thing has happened to me around dreams.......i sometimes will go into the dream of the person i am sleeping next to 
tg	wb 
tg	Wow. You must be connected to that person quite well and,or you are very sensitive. 
tg	wow horse 
tg	um, is it good or bad? 
tg	I am pretty sure my cat travels with me in dreams lol 
tg	well this happened to me while on my retreat with someone i did not know but was sharing a bed with 
tg	Perhaps you had a spiritual link? 
tg	ended up sleeping on floor because her dreams were death dreams which she shared the next day 
tg	Wow 
tg	ewwwww 
tg	would like to find a way of blocking it but when i sleep i do not seem to have any control over entering anothers mind 
tg	not fun at times 
tg	Have you tried using white light before bed? 
tg	how 
tg	yes 
tg	and asking for protection? 
tg	as well as blocking 
tg	yes 
tg	think this is a new tool i am to learn how to use.......maybe make their dreams more peaceful or something 
tg	interesting. Maybe you are meant to be a dream guide for others.
tg	this just started since my brain surgery 
tg	wow 
tg	one of the gifts i was given through that experience 
tg	how are you doing since the surgery? 
tg	doing well but have a bit of lost tools with new ones i need to learn how to use 
tg	I've not stepped into other people's dreams, but I've dreamt for people before as an intuitive tool 
tg	makes life interesting at times 
tg	I bet it does. 
tg	You help them through your dreams, Lila? 
tg	how does that work lila 
tg	dreaming for others is not the same as having my own dreams, the energy is different 
tg	Do you ask for advice for them? 
tg	i would think that would be much like journeying for them to find answers for what they are needing just a different form 
tg	Set the intent before sleeping to dream for a particular person to receive information to help see ways to assist them 
tg	agree WHW 
tg	yep 
tg	I'd like to try that 
tg	People have actually asked me to do that for them lila. 
tg	I started doing in a dream group and found it quite enjoyable 
tg	lila good idea, will try that one 
tg	Candy, get permission from the other person 
tg	sometimes i will also seek vision for another who has bad health or do sweat for them......does kinda the same thing 
tg	Good idea 
tg	yes of course 
tg	getting kinda old to do that for others though so need to find a young one to take over in the next ten years or so 
tg	too old to dream? 
tg	lila i find that many of my 'dreams' are really remembering astral travel 
tg	Horse I understand that one, 
tg	I tend to get marathon dreams and folks who don't recall their own dreams appreciate getting dream information this way 
tg	never too old to dream
tg	seek vision or sweat for another stephen 
tg	AH 
tg	of course a friend of mine says it can't be done, dreaming for someone else, He is into Jungian interpretation of dreams 
tg	That's your friend's reality, not yours
tg	days of fasting ....... climbing mountain that sort of thing. time to slow down on how many i do each year 
tg	Oh, I understand, WH 
tg	right Stephen, he shakes his head, I shake mine... lol 
tg	Sometimes people need to learn to do for themselves just my belief though 
tg	lol 
tg	I agree, KA 
tg	always preferable to intuit for yourself, but can be helpful to get an assist now and again 
tg	i agree ka but sometimes another also needs help of those younger or healthier 
tg	true Horse, as long s they don't become to dependant 
tg	if this was not so then there would be no need for healers 
tg	sometimes we can be too close to a situation to get the full picture 
tg	Good point, KA 
tg	well folks, it's been a fun ride in chat with all of you, but I must leave now. g'bye all 
tg	yes even i sometimes need to have another reflect back to me so i can see clearly 
tg	Good day, Lila 
tg	thanks again Stephen 
tg	i tend to be one who seeks the core of what i feel quite easily but there have been times that i have struggled with that 
tg	What do you mean by that? 
tg	such as feeling anger for another.......what about them is within me that i do not agree with that is causing the anger 
tg	Ahhhh. 
tg	sometimes i need another to point out what they see so i can understand 
tg	yes whw 
tg	speak about the anger as i try to find its core if i stuggle with it 
tg	i find the anger is not about the other person but about me 
tg	Yes, it's usually about us 
tg	or if i feel hurt or any thing along that line 
tg	yes 
tg	That mirror thing again
tg	yep 
tg	yep 
tg	mostly lately i have been lucky as it has been more around love of being 
tg	maybe giving me a break 
tg	Giving yourself a break 
tg	We all need breaks thats for sure 
tg	yes. 
tg	drat i must leave..my bird sitter is returning my bird to me..thank you again Stephen for sharing with us..I am looking forward to reading your book 
tg	yep storing up energy for the next aspect of self to show me how to embrace it 
tg	Thank you Morrigan 
tg	I'm going to depart now too. Thanks everyone 
tg	Nice to meet you Morrigan 
tg	thanks again stephen 
tg	and you KA come again soon 
tg	Thank You Stephen 
tg	walk in beauty 
tg	thank you stephen
tg	ty for the information stephen 
tg	drop by my site and say hello www.howisyourlovelife.com 
tg	again Love and Light to you Stephen 
tg	ty 
tg	You're welcome. Peace to all of you. 
tg	i would first like to take a minute to thank you michael for giving us this time to share your knowledge 
tg	yes, thank you michael 
tg	i for one know very little about astrology 
tg	how about everyone else...know something about it? 
tg	Does anyone want to share age and location info 
tg	very little 
tg	a bit...not a great deal 
tg	would you please do a brief intro of yourself michael so all can know your background before we start 
tg	would like to lean the discussion towards Energy Fields and Sun Signs 
tg	would be glad to whw 
tg	i'm a 51 year old male who has studied astrology for the past 22 years. before that, have spent most of my life seeking truth and community.i grew up in a contemporary family with standard values. always got into trouble by asking the question, why?...continue to ask...sometimes get answers...lol 
tg	how long have you been a professional astrologer. is there any testing required to become an astrologer 
tg	i opened my professional practice in 1990...a consulting office in my home. before that, 1988, i tested in Princeton, with the Educational Brance of the National Council of Geocosmic Research, received their Level I proficiency in Astrology. American Federation of Astrologers also tests for proficiency  
tg	what area of astrology would you like to address in discussion tonight 
tg	Sun Signs and Energy Fields 
tg	does everyone know their sun sign? 
tg	yes 
tg	not i 
tg	nor I 
tg	not I 
tg	it's where the sun was in the tropical zodiac at your birth 
tg	about.com has a marvelous Astrology site 
tg	explain? 
tg	a belt of stars ,constellations, surround our system 
tg	what does astrology have to do with energy fields 
tg	well some of the esotericist and some of the scientists claim that everything is a combination of energy 
tg	okay, so in the case of early July Cancer? 
tg	Cancer is a water sign and involves that type of energy, it fuels your selfhood. there are different schools of astrological thought on this...and i've looked into most. the western based astrology system looks at four basic 'types' of elements, fire, earth, air and water 
tg	so each sign has its own sunsign which effects your energy field? 
tg	each sign has its own energy field, the day of your birth determines where the sun was 
tg	how can you find that out? 
tg	there is a book listing all the positions, it's called an ephemeris 
tg	hi jean 
tg	hi folks...glad I could get home in time to catch some of this 
tg	so once we know our sun sign then ??? 
tg	if you could think of the universe pouring forth different wavelengths of energy during the cycle of the earth's movement around the sun and the earth as a resonant 'tuning fork' vibrating to those different forces you can get an idea of the many ways the earth absorbs and expresses those energies, the seasons of the year...it's cycles are the prime example. 
tg	once you know your sun sign...that tells you what 'fuel' ,energy, you use to propell and move you through experience, that would be your most optimum fuel source 
tg	so once you know your sun sign you can determine they type of enegy field associated with it? 
tg	how do you figure out your sun sign 
tg	it's what strengthens you and expands your sense of joy, energy, even status as a small personality with a great soul 
tg	yes...fire, earth, air, and water 
tg	aries, leo, saggitarius are fires signs 
tg	well i am aquarius so does that mean right off water 
tg	taurus, virgo, capricorn are earth signs 
tg	hey..me to whw 
tg	right off water? not exactly, but you're close 
tg	i'll continue... 
tg	please do 
tg	gemini, libra, aquarius are air signs 
tg	cancer, scorpio, pisces are water signs 
tg	if you feel the need to re fuel...go after those elements 
tg	they can be represented by fire sunshine, gold, yellow, passionate and intuitive experiences 
tg	what does air energy carry? 
tg	sharing...the air you breathe today will be shared in the breath of another on a different part of the globe tomorrow 
tg	thinking is the quality of air signs 
tg	thoughts, inventions, windy days ,and nights,, communication in all forms are experienced similarly by all air signs 
tg	seek out those things when you need uplifting 
tg	how do you determine the type of energy field associated with each sun sign 
tg	how about the energy of water signs? 
tg	by the element and its corresponding associations 
tg	fire needs firey experiences...find the passion 
tg	air needs to share and explore 
tg	earth needs groundedness, stability, material expression and pleasure 
tg	water needs feelings, intuition, to be swept into the embrace of humanity. each sign is one of those four elements 
tg	does everyone agree with your determination? 
tg	no...the world has many cultures and the agreed upon 'constructs' of reality are different...but there are similarities amongst all peoples 
tg	what would strengthen a person's energy field 
tg	i like to use astrology as a tool for timing and to 'navigate' through life. those experiences that resonate with that field. lines of force are movements of energy 
tg	could you maybe give a few examples? 
tg	creative fire, such as leo, needs to shine, not just for self, but to create another 
tg	trailblazing aries needs to clear a path and move strongly and with great force towards the desired goal 
tg	so then what would weaken a person's energy field? 
tg	upreaching saggitarius requires continuous searching for every more illuminating experience and adventure 
tg	overindulgence can weaken, too much of anything can weaken or the constant struggle to maintain your natural sun sign's energy field in an environment that is not conducive to your energy can weaken 
tg	so then too much searching for the saggitarius could end up weakening them? 
tg	indeed, whw 
tg	because there is a need for the balance in all things. the universe has ways of wisdomand we are not created for ourselves alone. also...there are other celestial bodies that need fueling 
tg	as an astrologer how would you correct or adjust an unbalance in an energy field 
tg	my last statement leads into that whw 
tg	k 
tg	the moon...represents our urge for emotional expression, nurturing and gathering 
tg	mercury makes connections, both internally ,nervous system, and externally ,communication, 
tg	venus is our desire nature, and the pleasure principle...relationships also 
tg	mars is our assertive natures, how we go after what we desire...and our courage 
tg	there are 8 planets in our system ,that are accepted as such, plus the star ,sun, and our earth's satellite ,moon, 
tg	am i talking too much? 
tg	not at all michael 
tg	nope 
tg	no 
tg	each planet is like a function within each person 
tg	what does mercury in retrograde mean? 
tg	and, through my studies, i've seen how the saying, 'as above, so below' contains truth 
tg	the symbol for retrograde is Rx, that is latin for pre script...'what was written before' so a planet moving retrograde would allow that planets function to re gain a position of health, that exists prior to it's movement backward. the planet appears to move backwards in the sky 
tg	ty 
tg	mercury retrograde is the thinking function turning back upon itself...going over ground it has already moved across...re thinking. because of the intricate play of forces amongst the planets and stars there are times where a balance needs to be restored in the universe so ,from this planet's perspective, a retrograde period comes into play to correct an unbalance ...mercury moves the quickest ,quicksilver, and goes 'retrograde' the most often of the planets 
tg	so these events happen to correct the unbalance if we are willing to move with them 
tg	indeed, true, whw 
tg	and they happen even if we are unwilling to move with them...that is when they can be 'troublesome' 
tg	aaaaahhhhhh maybe caused more unbalance within ourself? 
tg	but, just as in healing techniques, sometimes the area needing healing resurfaces to be released 
tg	this may be why some issues come up again and again until we do something about them. 
tg	indeed, that is true, pooky 
tg	as an astrologer i look at where those bodies were when you were born. Carl Jung, in his studies of astrology, says that everthing that occurs in a moment of time shares the quality of that moment. this keys me into what the character, personality, and ,sometimes, soul's purpose for this lifetime. then, i compare with what is going on in the skies ,as above, so below, to what was at birth, that leads me into areas of ease or disease ,difficulty, for my client. Ee then move into discussion and exploration of options  
tg	where can i find additional information on this 
tg	again, about.com is an excellent resource in their astrology site, i would suggest contacting a competent astrologer 
tg	do you have a web site michael 
tg	no, not yet 
tg	do you do any of this via the Internet if someone would desire to email you? 
tg	you could contact the American Federation of Astrologers or the National Council for Geocosmic Research...each refers to their qualified astrologers. whw, i consult in my office or by telephone...i would also be willing to refer to an astrologer close to you 
tg	do you have any closing recommendations michael? Maybe others have some questions 
tg	please, questions anyone? 
tg	How important is it to know the time of birth? 
tg	i have one, but i'll let others go first 
tg	very important, time of birth determines what position of the sky is rising on the horizon and above and below the earth, as well as setting...the planets are in a certain position of the sky. so the time determines where those planets are, but...you can make significant determinations by just the date born 
tg	so although important, if you can't or don't know then it can still be an accurate reading? 
tg	yes, indeed pooky...just not 'as accurate' as a known birthtime 
tg	just knowing what element you sun was in when you were born is very helpful for health and well being most astrology sites will tell you what element your sun sign is  
tg	ty. from that you can seek out those foods, activities, experiences that enhance that 
tg	yw, pooky 
tg	i want to thank you once again michael for sharing with us. maybe we can do another one that goes further in depth some time soon 
tg	that would be my pleasure...and i thank all of you for the opportunity to share my knowledge in my search for truth 
tg	michael thanks for being here and sharing with us 
tg	yw, tao 
tg	yw Thank you for your time 
tg	ty Michael 
tg	please share your question tao 
tg	my pleasure, all.... 
tg	michael, this is very esoteric, but have you looked at approaches like Annie Besant's? 
tg	yes, indeed, tao 
tg	she was a contempary of Alice Bailey 
tg	obviously, choice to agree or not, but what is your opinion of the concept of spiritual entities being responsible for the energies shared by planets, constellations, etc. as a way to describe Divine Purpose behind those energies 
tg	i agree with the concept of holism ,wholes within wholes,...so i find the contemplation of...in whom do we move and have our being' to be a fruitful search. Theosophy and anthroposophy are retlated fields of study  
tg	welcome to healing,newage chat candy 
tg	agree...thanks...is possible to find harmony in many approaches 
tg	yes....anthroposophy is very interesting...Rudolf Steiner 
tg	will need to say goodnight, as i have a bit of packing to do for tomorrow's 2 day fair. i'll be doing astrology,tarot readings there  
tg	walk in beauty everyone 
tg	and in light, whw

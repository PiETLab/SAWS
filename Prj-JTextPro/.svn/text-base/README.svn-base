Directory structure:
--------------------

    lib			contains the library and the output of compiling process
    models		contains trained models: sentence segmentation, POS tagging, and phrase chunking
    samples		contains sample input data files
    src			contains source code files
    Makefile		make file
    README		this one


How to compile JTextPro:
------------------------

    make clean
    make all
    

How to test:
------------

    make test
    
    after testing, go to samples directory to see the outputs
    

How to use JTextPro:
---------------------

    command line:
    
    case 1:
	
	java -mx512M -classpath <CLASSPATH> jtextpro.JTextProcessor <MODELS DIRECTORY> <INPUT FILE>
	
    where:
	
	-mx512M: to extend heap memory for JVM
	
	<CLASSPATH> is the path to the "jtextpro.jar" file. For instance, if we are currently at 
	the home directory of JTextPro, the <CLASSPATH> is "./lib/jtextpro.jar"
	
	<MODELS DIRECTORY> is the path to the directory containing three trained models
	(sentence segmentation, POS tagging, and phrase chunking models). For instance, if we are 
	currently at the home directory	of JTextPro, the <MODELS DIRECTORY> is "./models"
	
	<INPUT FILE> is the input text file that needs to be processed. See the sample input files
	in ./samples directory
	
    example:
    
	if we are currently at the top (home) directory of JTextPro and we would like to process
	an input file named "input.txt" which is located in the "samples" directory, we use the
	following command line:
	
	java -mx512M -classpath ./lib/jtextpro.jar:. jtextpro.JTextProcessor ./models ./samples/input.txt
	
	the output will be "input.txt.out"
	
Notes:
------

    - Because loading trained models into internal memory is quite time-consuming. You should load
    them once at the beginning and then process multiple files together to avoid loading them 
    again and again. Please, see the ./src/jtextpro/JTextProcessor.java source code file to modify 
    a little bit to do that.
    
    - All API functions are in ./src/jtextpro/JTextPro.java source code file.
    
    - To compile JTextPro on Windows, modify the Makefile to replace the path separator character
    "/" by "\"

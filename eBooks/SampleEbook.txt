MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF ANCIENT GREECE AND ROME.PART I.--MYTHS.INTRODUCTION.Before entering upon the many strange beliefs of the ancient Greeks, andthe extraordinary number of gods they worshipped, we must first considerwhat kind of beings these divinities were.In appearance, the gods were supposed to resemble mortals, whom, however,they far surpassed in beauty, grandeur, and strength; they were also morecommanding in stature, height being considered by the Greeks an attributeof beauty in man or woman. They resembled human beings in their feelingsand habits, intermarrying and having children, and requiring dailynourishment to recruit their strength, and refreshing sleep to restoretheir energies. Their blood, a bright ethereal fluid called Ichor, neverengendered disease, and, when shed, had the power of producing new life.The Greeks believed that the mental qualifications of their gods were of amuch higher order than those of men, but nevertheless, as we shall see,they were not considered to be exempt from human passions, and wefrequently behold them actuated by revenge, deceit, and jealousy. They,however, always punish the evil-doer, and visit with dire calamities anyimpious mortal who dares to neglect their worship or despise their rites.We often hear of them visiting mankind and partaking of their hospitality,and not unfrequently both gods and goddesses {8} become attached tomortals, with whom they unite themselves, the offspring of these unionsbeing called heroes or demi-gods, who were usually renowned for their greatstrength and courage. But although there were so many points of resemblancebetween gods and men, there remained the one great characteristicdistinction, viz., that the gods enjoyed immortality. Still, they were notinvulnerable, and we often hear of them being wounded, and suffering inconsequence such exquisite torture that they have earnestly prayed to bedeprived of their privilege of immortality.The gods knew no limitation of time or space, being able to transportthemselves to incredible distances with the speed of thought. Theypossessed the power of rendering themselves invisible at will, and couldassume the forms of men or animals as it suited their convenience. Theycould also transform human beings into trees, stones, animals, &c., eitheras a punishment for their misdeeds, or as a means of protecting theindividual, thus transformed, from impending danger. Their robes were likethose worn by mortals, but were perfect in form and much finer in texture.Their weapons also resembled those used by mankind; we hear of spears,shields, helmets, bows and arrows, &c., being employed by the gods. Eachdeity possessed a beautiful chariot, which, drawn by horses or otheranimals of celestial breed, conveyed them rapidly over land and seaaccording to their pleasure. Most of these divinities lived on the summitof Mount Olympus, each possessing his or her individual habitation, and allmeeting together on festive occasions in the council-chamber of the gods,where their banquets were enlivened by the sweet strains of Apollo's lyre,whilst the beautiful voices of the Muses poured forth their rich melodiesto his harmonious accompaniment. Magnificent temples were erected to theirhonour, where they were worshipped with the greatest solemnity; rich giftswere presented to them, and animals, and indeed sometimes human beings,were sacrificed on their altars.In the study of Grecian mythology we meet with some {9} curious, and whatmay at first sight appear unaccountable notions. Thus we hear of terriblegiants hurling rocks, upheaving mountains, and raising earthquakes whichengulf whole armies; these ideas, however, may be accounted for by theawful convulsions of nature, which were in operation in pre-historic times.Again, the daily recurring phenomena, which to us, who know them to be theresult of certain well-ascertained laws of nature, are so familiar as toexcite no remark, were, to the early Greeks, matter of grave speculation,and not unfrequently of alarm. For instance, when they heard the awful roarof thunder, and saw vivid flashes of lightning, accompanied by black cloudsand torrents of rain, they believed that the great god of heaven was angry,and they trembled at his wrath. If the calm and tranquil sea becamesuddenly agitated, and the crested billows rose mountains high, dashingfuriously against the rocks, and threatening destruction to all withintheir reach, the sea-god was supposed to be in a furious rage. When theybeheld the sky glowing with the hues of coming day they thought that thegoddess of the dawn, with rosy fingers, was drawing aside the dark veil ofnight, to allow her brother, the sun-god, to enter upon his brilliantcareer. Thus personifying all the powers of nature, this very imaginativeand highly poetical nation beheld a divinity in every tree that grew, inevery stream that flowed, in the bright beams of the glorious sun, and theclear, cold rays of the silvery moon; for them the whole universe lived andbreathed, peopled by a thousand forms of grace and beauty.

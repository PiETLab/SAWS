tg	First I would like to thanks candy for inviting here. 
tg	Once Thomas is done with what he is sharing at first then we will have question and answers time ok? 
tg	I am thomas Oates 
tg	I had CFIDS from 1989 to 1993 and now I am completely well. When I cam down with it I was selling Life Insurance in TN and now I am a filmmaker in Seattle. I have written several articles, a manuscript on how I healed and produced films that create peace within people. So I know how to find My healing path.....and I think I can help you all find yours. 
tg	cool 
tg	Your path will different however, the dynamics and questions that need to be asked will be the same. First of I wonder how many of have considered the differance between healing and getting well or being 'cured'  
tg	y 
tg	show of hands.. 
tg	y 
tg	y 
tg	y 
tg	y 
tg	cool 
tg	WAVING 
tg	y 
tg	hands 
tg	y 
tg	well I was a little slow, it took me about 3 years of being an invalid before I started to think about the differance 
tg	y 
tg	ok 
tg	How many of you are secretly still trying to find a pill or doctor that will cure you? you don't have to answer
tg	me 
tg	me me 
tg	nope they don't have the cure 
tg	ditto 
tg	there is nothing wrong with that as long as it's not your primary hope 
tg	part of the picture 
tg	For me healing involved a complete resignation to my predicament and then a surrender to my heart in the moment 
tg	agree Morri 
tg	Gettng to this place of complete surrender was the hard part. My ego had to be completely cut down to size. It was obviously very painful in an ego suffering kind of way. But I got there, there was a great peace. A peace so powerful and overwhelming that it was like tuching the edge of some amazing state of grace It was beautiful and I knew that I would healsomeday. I did not care when. I just knew that eventually I would 
tg	wow 
tg	how did you accomplish this? 
tg	i need peace badly 
tg	that is the big question 
tg	Seeking this path of peace is the foundation for all healing. Re aligning our qustions and priorities is how we find our own healing paths. Instead of asking what pill can I take, ask questions that will engage your heart and spirit in the moment 
tg	so the question is as important as the answer? 
tg	the question is infinantly more important than the answer...our spirits, and thus our lives and healing path are directed by the questions we ask..so asking what pill can I take is kind of a dead end. but asking how may I use my limited energy in a joyful creative way?is very healing 
tg	ask, What is it I want to do now....is it painting? Writing a story. something creative that engages your heart and mind and body in the present moment. for me it was photography. 
tg	oops 
tg	he will be back, he was having trouble with that computer 
tg	I also feel starngly drawn to photography 
tg	might be something to explore Obsidian 
tg	ok 
tg	any way where was I? Could someone cut and paste my last line 
tg	for me it was photography 
tg	ty 
tg	The point it to find that joyful activity that engaged you in the creative monent this brings us to the presesnt. Healing happens in the present. If we are worried or stressed or fearful we are not in the healing present 
tg	my brain's so confused i wouldnt even no what I like 
tg	but many people have no idea what it is they love to do ... creatively 
tg	exactly, so we have to back up. how can you figure out what it is you like or love to do? This brings me to step one of my 12 steps to finding your healing path. We spend tooo much time thinking about how we are NOT energized. we use all we have 
tg	y 
tg	thomas is this a 12 step program? 
tg	Here Are 12 Concrete Things that I did every day that allowed me to reach a state that removed the roadblocks from my healing path. 1. Keeping A Journal I kept a daily journal of what I did and how I felt physically, emotionally and mentally. I recorded my dreams consistently and reviewed them every few months to look for recurring themes, ideas, advice. A journal also helped identify what I had done earlier that caused a relapse. It was always a delayed reaction for me.   I would feel better, go out and do something that I thought would help build my strength, and end up deep in the pillow for days after, wondering what happened. The journal sped up the learning curve and helped me to identify energy drains. 
tg	i don't remeber my dreams 
tg	the journal is to your healing path like the hub of a wheel is to the spokes 
tg	how may of keep a journal? 
tg	of sorts 
tg	I do 
tg	no 
tg	not I any more 
tg	no 
tg	do you have a site with this information posted on it? 
tg	i do but nt on a regular bases 
tg	no 
tg	I cannot emphasize how important the journal is 
tg	journal of dreams? 
tg	everything 
tg	why 
tg	a journal is useful for many things in addition to this 
tg	ok 
tg	I try but have not been doing good with it lately 
tg	How many time have you had an insight, inspiration or fleeting thought? 
tg	many 
tg	many times 
tg	thought about something and then brushed aside and disregarded it 
tg	especially gardening 
tg	these small fleeting thoughts are your heart speaking 
tg	k 
tg	spending money I really love 
tg	a journal catches these ideas like snapshots 
tg	so in addition to writing a journal we would be wise to read it in a regular way 
tg	yes 
tg	like going over the past week etc 
tg	I kept a journal while I was ill and over time the fleeting though of making films kept comming to me 
tg	without a journal I would not have been able to catch this guidance 
tg	over time the journal does not lie 
tg	Julia Cameron said that only through writing down our story are we able to see who we are 
tg	healing involves finding discovering what we love to do...it is the best medicine...also dreams are an invaluable resource. how may of you remember your dreams? 
tg	I do 
tg	not me 
tg	cool 
tg	all dreams or many,some? 
tg	are all dreams valuable? is what I mean to ask  
tg	few 
tg	angel, do you wake up with an alarm? 
tg	most of them 
tg	maybe a little or some parts of it 
tg	hi kate 
tg	yes 
tg	the alarm is the reason 
tg	Yayish 
tg	i have to 
tg	I don't remember...and I don't use an alarm, or very very seldom remember 
tg	how about dogs waking you up would that be the same as alarm 
tg	one we begin to ask question before we go to sleep and ask to be guided then our dreams become a powerful resource 
tg	i don't know, do you remember your dreams 
tg	most of the time but not always 
tg	good 
tg	it is the interpreting that is hard part 
tg	so the point is that these dreams, fleeting ideas etc. need to be captured 
tg	i agree yayish 
tg	always puzzling 
tg	even nightmares count huh? 
tg	over time the information in your journal will have common themes 
tg	I don't think you need to interpret...just be aware of common threads or themes 
tg	oops 
tg	what do the themes tell us 
tg	yes 
tg	especially if you ask healing question 
tg	like.. 
tg	How may I use the energy I have in a joyful way 
tg	good one 
tg	how may I use the energy I have in a creative and heartflet, joyful way 
tg	but some nightmares dreams are also cause by lets say some event u saw during day... perhaps movie. 
tg	not How can I get well, this is self pitying 
tg	you wouldn't get a answer from that 
tg	thomas that is a cultural thing for some people 
tg	I think that would also be part of the puzzle...still write it down 
tg	darn 
tg	ut oh..not just me that peabody likes 
tg	he will be back 
tg	hb thomas lol 
tg	huh???? 
tg	booted? 
tg	frustrating eh??? 
tg	recess? 
tg	i agree lightbr, some things even from movies tell us something 
tg	yup 
tg	chanting here thomas 
tg	welcome jera 
tg	mm 
tg	hi Jera 
tg	hi Jera 
tg	love and light to you 
tg	blessings jera welcome to healing 
tg	hi jera 
tg	one dream will not give you all that you are seeking...you have to see the theme 
tg	we are waiting for Mr. Oates to get back in jera 
tg	what kinds of things should we write down during the day? 
tg	now who is this 'Thomas Oates' fellow, and what will he teach? 
tg	yes i want to know too Jera 
tg	12 steps 
tg	I find that things that cause 'emotions'...are the most valuable 
tg	how to reach your own healing path Jera 
tg	sweet 
tg	and important to notice what you 'feel' 
tg	ohhhhh...great 
tg	lol, I will never ay that again 
tg	say even 
tg	he mentions to make note of dreams and little fleeting thoughts, for that is your heart talking, so make a journal 
tg	should we write every event during the day that would be alot? 
tg	this is his website if you want to look around 
tg	cool 
tg	the things that cause you the most emotions...happy, sad, fearful.... 
tg	the things that make you 'wonder' 
tg	ty candy putting in favs now lol 
tg	angel perhaps the significant ones and how it impacted u? 
tg	angel every dream dear,  not everything that happens to you, things that impress you 
tg	what if we have so much stress in our lives 
tg	ditto lightbr 
tg	but we cant get rid of it then what? 
tg	ok 
tg	angel...lots is a matter of 'preception' 
tg	angel that is what you are trying to release by these methods 
tg	sorry my dsl connection is bad 
tg	wb thomas 
tg	so how many of you all want me to continue or would you like to ask question now 
tg	please 
tg	continue 
tg	LOL 
tg	continue 
tg	continue 
tg	i gave them your website while you were gone Tom 
tg	so it's the questions that are so important 
tg	thomas may i just ask do you personally know Nakai 
tg	it is the questions we ask ourselves everyday that direct our spirit 
tg	and therefore our healing paths 
tg	or our healing ruts 
tg	I have met Nakai, He does not know me from Adam 
tg	awe 
tg	lol 
tg	oh all my lols are lots of love 
tg	ok 
tg	listening 
tg	so I guess one of the first things we need to do to get out of our healing ruts is reevaluate how we see our own healing 
tg	are we expecting to be cured or are we seeking to cultivate peace and creative joy in the moment 
tg	there is a huge differance 
tg	?????? 
tg	do you mean find peace and creative joy in our illness?? 
tg	no 
tg	Explain please 
tg	let see.... 
tg	light, what did you enjoy doing in highschool? What hobby? What subject did you enjoy? 
tg	so in turn tha creative joy and peace is what leads to healing of self in the mean time or an avenue to repond well and feel perhaps less stress out about things once we see things lighter than we originally saw it.. 
tg	I don't remember...LOL 
tg	? 
tg	ok 
tg	Healing is peace and peace is healing, for the words are the same. You cannot experience peace without healing. Illness cannot exist where there is peace?  
tg	So when or where do you experience peace? 
tg	Are you talking about spiritual healing and not physical healing?? 
tg	for me its when I am painnting 
tg	EVERYTHING 
tg	i had a dream last wekk that the star in the sky glowed at me and i was smiling in my dream andn felt peace which i had never felt and somone spoke how does this feel 
tg	healing 
tg	so if you do something and it causes pain stay away from it? 
tg	So are you saying that when we find inner peace...we will not be ill?? A little confused...sorry 
tg	peace is experienced when we are engaged in the present moment 
tg	yes rainbow 
tg	in a sense light 
tg	I know that disease is a teacher....but...have trouble bringing it to the next step 
tg	there is a place of such profound peace and joy that if you were there but your body was still ill, you would not care 
tg	Ok...I can understand that 
tg	oh been there 
tg	you would be so joyful and filled with peace that your illness would be of no consequence 
tg	this is what happened to me 
tg	Ok...can understand that 
tg	but thomas one doesn't stay there continully 
tg	you don't need to 
tg	true 
tg	well then I'm healed 
tg	mm 
tg	just knowing that it is there changes how you view everything 
tg	what of those illness forces you to leave behind, thomas? you have children? the peace surpasses that? 
tg	very good 
tg	does that really work when having to integrate to life in this world, and how hard is it to keep up that kind of energy without having a horrible crash from time to time? 
tg	real life does take away from it 
tg	I thought so 
tg	but it takes no energy to be there... 
tg	where? 
tg	It takes 'letting go'...a lot 
tg	to maintain there is what I was questioning 
tg	if you are struggling to have peace in your life you are on the wrong track, cultivating peace is about letting go 
tg	oh thats me 
tg	how do we let go 
tg	where your heart knows where. 
tg	the idea then is to come to a place of such peace that the illness and earthly things are of no consequence? 
tg	angel...letting go of the things that are causing you all that stress you talked about 
tg	ask before you go to sleep 
tg	you let go by no longer iving the negitive aspect of the situation any energy 
tg	peace is the symptom of having completely resigned to your predicament and surrendering to your heart. Peace is the symptom of being on yourhealing path  
tg	I see no evolution in that tom 
tg	what if im dealing with my cfs, can't wor,k just found out my son has autism, my rent went up and I'm to sick to move and my ex won't give me more money and his girlfriend is getting violent... then what? 
tg	Ahhh...but we are so resistent some times... 
tg	please don't be condescending 
tg	when faced with a choice and the its between something that feels like a struggle and not struggle which way are you going to go? 
tg	Obsidian....explain..evolution in what? 
tg	so I should just give up trying to get better, and say this is where I am and this is where I will always be... 
tg	ahhhhhh 
tg	but resignation, surrender does not equal giving up 
tg	big difference 
tg	I tell you what if I had done that I'd be dead by now 
tg	Resignation is giving in, not giving up. We resign and surrender to our hearts joy... resign to to our situation and surrender to our hearts. Does that make sense? 
tg	thomas are your 12 stp parallel to the 12 step AA program by your suggestion of surrendering 
tg	I suffer mental illness. I have resigned the fact that I have mental illness  
tg	maybe, I am not familiar with the AA 12 steps 
tg	this is only a first step along this journey of wellness 
tg	I also have to do something active to bring about change and healing 
tg	thomas do you work with people online or on phone? 
tg	I believe we all do 
tg	you believe in the prayer God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference 
tg	y 
tg	that's it 
tg	thats part of the 12 step progam thomas 
tg	ok 
tg	Let go of the need to 'control' what is happening?? 
tg	healing involves change, and people had almost rather die than change  
tg	do you have your interuption of the 12 step program posted 
tg	thomas dp you work one on one with people on phone? 
tg	my 12 steps are, one sec I will post the url 
tg	I would be happy to help any one...206 216 0720 
tg	let's try to remember that thomas is speaking of healing in regards to dealing with CFS folks 
tg	yes I am not a doctor. therapist, but I have help a lot of people  
tg	but this can also be used in healing with anything 
tg	yes, healing is healing, the dynamics of it is the same  
tg	are there any other questions? 
tg	what is CFS, chronic fatigue? 
tg	Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
tg	What if we only remember bits and pieces of our dreams? 
tg	angel then those are the ones that are important 
tg	but can't remeber the whole dream tho 
tg	the more you foccus on them and seek to understand them the more you will begin to remember 
tg	thomas are the steps..or the 'place of peace' akin to meditation? 
tg	it's truely amazing the information we have access to in our dreams 
tg	why can't we ask how can we get better? 
tg	it's the point of meditation to get there, I am just a really bad meditator 
tg	ok...thank you very much 
tg	Painting is my meditation 
tg	during dreams is the only time our mind is quiet enough for spirit to come through to help us 
tg	the videos I produce shift you from stress to peace 
tg	thomas what if we can't get rid of the stressors in our life right now 
tg	ok. things change 
tg	ty 
tg	you will not always have these stressors and when the opportunity arrives make a differant choice 
tg	also be VERY weary of the word CAN'T 
tg	ok so even if we still have then it will help to find the peace that we are looking for 
tg	even if you can shift the stress for small amounts of time when you are able, it will add to healing right? 
tg	for obsidian, the difference is between having a terminal diagnosis and a diagnosis that you must learn to live with 
tg	yyy 
tg	yes guest 
tg	can't implies that we have no choice 
tg	ditto Guest ty 
tg	this is a very dangerious thought 
tg	we all are born with free will 
tg	when we deny ourself the right of choice by saying 'I can't ' we are inviting god to completely destroy our live until we see that yes indeed we have a choice 
tg	And because we have free will...we can only get help from the universe if we ask... 
tg	it is the rule number 1....we all have infinite choices in every moment 
tg	please do not forget this 
tg	so then in chosing to not accept the diagnosis that i would never walk again...i wasn't fighting my illness i was using free will when i got out of the chair? 
tg	charles dubois said, the important thing is being willing at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become 
tg	we may not like the choices but they are there 
tg	that would depend on you intention. 
tg	there is a reason for every thing 
tg	do you find the best choices are usually the hard choices? 
tg	trying to understand..because i walk today because i fight my illness and don't give in to it 
tg	but that is my choice to do so 
tg	that's where the confusion comes in...are we choosing to be ill with our CFS?? 
tg	very good 
tg	very hard to understand Morrigan but the accepting part is what we fight 
tg	you are fighting yourself then as you aren't seperate from illness 
tg	I must really be being resistant with this concept 
tg	oh boy...not conciously. I certainly did not choose it 10 years ago 
tg	it is like if you got a speeding ticket in a forign country because you did not understand the road signs you still get put in jail. But you may say 'I can't read chinese' That does not matter.  
tg	what causes CFS? 
tg	So maybe I'm not reading the signs of the lesson I'm to learn from this illness?? 
tg	this is also a Cultural thing 
tg	we are governed by universal laws 
tg	when we live out of harmony with them . we become sick, we are thrown in jail 
tg	right...I agree...so I'm out of harmony...out of balance....blocked in some way?? 
tg	just because we are not aware of them does not excuse us from living within them 
tg	It's filling some purpose?? 
tg	individual culturals look at illness in many different ways 
tg	illness serves the ill in some way 
tg	healing also involves seeing how we are living out of balance and correcting the imbalances, thus moving back into harmony with life. Wholeness 
tg	So if I ask for help...and keep a journal...then some common theme will come through?? 
tg	yyy 
tg	hummm 
tg	guarantee it 
tg	it's the acceptance of what we look like and how we do things via palsy or mental illness or just pain 
tg	it must be a heartfelt asking 
tg	can i ask how to find the peace? 
tg	ok...next...if I find the theme....purpose...how do I get over the resistance to change this?? 
tg	I don't understand your question rainbow 
tg	sure 
tg	how to find peace... 
tg	um 
tg	that dream last week felt so good when I had peace for that 1 minute in my dream 
tg	Peace is a symptom not a goal. We experience peace when we are present 
tg	thomas my ? is do you see it in individuals who see things in a cultural way some can't accept all the same way 
tg	a symptom of balance 
tg	it is most easily experienced when we do something creative and joyful in the moment 
tg	I am not advocating any 'one way' peace if cultivated by following our own hearts path. Where that leads you is your path. 
tg	so if i understand correctly, we will be at peace when we give our energy to joyful things instead of things that bring us pain or stress 
tg	yyy...like trading 
tg	Can you address 'resistance'...even if we find the thread, lesson, etc...how do we get over the resistance 
tg	resistance...umm..thats a tuffy 
tg	yes...I find I have very strong resistance... 
tg	I think it must be fear related 
tg	could be 
tg	healing involves change 
tg	the fear of feeling better? 
tg	resistance for me personally revolves around fear 
tg	and people would rather die than change...the ego dies hard 
tg	the fear of changing, letting go of illness, as illness serves the ill 
tg	soooo...how do you address that...trick your ego....change it??? 
tg	it's just change. it's hard...letting go of an old life. it's like a death in the family 
tg	are there techniques?? 
tg	man I just got to the point where I would do anything in order to heal 
tg	all of my energy, focus, strength revolved around letting go of struggle and cultivating peace 
tg	lightbr like he says finds an incentive.. how does 'healing' sound as an incentive... will you drop the resistence for that goal?. 
tg	y 
tg	i have to sleep thanks thomas that was great 
tg	If I haven't done it by now...it is obviously to me that I must have tremendous resistance 
tg	love and light to you Angel 
tg	we all do 
tg	love and light to all of you 
tg	out u don't believe it could happen 
tg	good night angel thanks for listening 
tg	Oh...I have great belief...but something stops me from doing it 
tg	I have 3 uninvited guests,  fear, jealousy, love 
tg	beliefs don't heal.....questions that direct our spirit and lives heal 
tg	questions?? 
tg	but u even said.. ask like u truly mean it.. from the heart.. and for that to happen for u truly to mean it u must belief that is all possible... 
tg	ask how you may use the energy you have in a joyful creative way? and see what happens to your life 
tg	y 
tg	I have written that down...and will surely try it 
tg	ask over and over. 
tg	the answer is out there 
tg	yes...I know that spirit does not work on my time frame..LOL 
tg	there is nothing but a great hope 
tg	yes unfortunately it's none of our ego's business when we heal 
tg	LOL...true 
tg	well it has got to be getting pretty late on the east coast 
tg	You know...I even am resistant about keeping a journal...so much resistance to healing...geezzz 
tg	I would be happy to talk to anyone .... 
tg	tis about 1115 here 
tg	light it's ok, someday you will heal.. 
tg	The Yankees lost...and sat. night live is not on yet...LOL 
tg	yankees lost. cool 
tg	ligh the good thing is you know you have the resistance and admit to it 
tg	thank you so much for your time and energy thomas
